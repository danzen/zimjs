A. ABOUT ZIM
ZIM is an JavaScript Canvas Framework powered by CreateJS and adds many components, conveniences and controls for making general Interactive Media.

The ZIM site at http://zimjs.com features the following sections:

LEARN tutorials on how to start and code in ZIM
EDITOR online editor with lots of Zapps for reference
CODE the template, tools and libraries
STORE examples of ZIM mobile PWA apps
DOCS the objects and commands all defined
ABOUT features, applications, archives, reviews, etc.
EXAMPLES sample projects created in ZIM
GOLD BARS with intro, site map, tips, resources and sharing tool 

B. ABOUT THE DOCS
The docs are divided into modules:
FRAME, DISPLAY, METHODS, CONTROLS, CODE, WRAP, META, LIBRARIES
Let's have a brief look at each...

---------------------------------
1. FRAME - the framework class that makes and scales the canvas and stage
new Frame(FIT, 1024, 768, light, dark, ready, ["pic.png", "sound.mp3"]); 
function ready() {
	// given F, S, W, H - for frame, stage, stageW, stageH
	const aud = new Aud("sound.mp3");
	const pic = new Pic(pic.png).center().tap(()=&gt;{
		aud.play();
	});
} // end ready

---------------------------------
3. DISPLAY - classes for objects viewed on the stage like shapes and components
const circle = new Circle(100, "red"); // also Rectangle, Triangle and Blob
const button = new Button(200, 100, "GO!");
etc. and dozens more like Label, Slider, Dial, Tabs, ColorPicker...

---------------------------------
4. METHODS - methods for the display objects above
circle.center(); // adds to and centers button on stage
circle.drag(); // allows the circle to be dragged and dropped
circle.animate(props:{alpha:0}, 5); // fades out circle over 5 seconds
etc. and dozens more - also see PRINCIPLES sections below...

---------------------------------
5. CONTROLS - classes that affect Display objects
new MotionController(circle); // circle moves to mouse press
new Pages([home, help]); // handle pages and swiping
new Layout(S, [{object:header},{object:content},{object:footer}]);
responsive design with many more options (like css flex table)
etc. including Parallax, Scroller, Guide, Grid, Emitter, SoundWave...

---------------------------------
5. CODE - non-Canvas code convienence functions
const array = ["red", "yellow", "green", "blue"];
let color = pluck(array); // gets a random element
let color = shuffle(array)[0]; // shuffles array and picks first color (same as above)
let color = array[rand(array.length-1)]; // gets random element (same as above)
etc. many more including browser functions and asynchronus calls

---------------------------------
6. WRAP - a dozen three-letter global functions starting with z
zog("hello world"); // short for console.log();
zid("tagID"); // short for document.getElementById();
etc. including selectors similar to $() in jQuery

---------------------------------
7. META - a few classes and functions operating on zim
DISTILL = true;
distill(); // writes to console all the commands used to reduce code
zimify(createjsObj); // adds zim Methods to native createjs display objects
wonder.count("wow"); // once set up records different types of stats

---------------------------------
8. LIBRARIES - other ZIM helper modules found here:
http://zimjs.com/code.html#libraries
Including: SOCKET, GAME, PHYSICS, THREE, CAM, PIZZAZZ 1, 2 and 3 modules

C. THE DOCS

------------------------------------
MODULE 1: ZIM FRAME
------------------------------------

************************************
[76896] Frame(scaling, width, height, color, outerColor, ready, assets, path, progress, ticker, rollover, touch, scrollTop, align, valign, canvasID, rollPerSecond, delay, canvasCheck, gpu, gpuObj, nextFrame, nextStage, allowDefault, loadFailObj, sensors, retina, mouseMoveOutside, captureMouse, shim, maxConnections, maxNum, singleTouch)

Frame
zim class - extends a createjs EventDispatcher

DESCRIPTION
Frame creates a canvas and stage.
Frame lets you decide how you want your stage to scale.
It also provides events for ready, resizing and orientation change
as well as a way to remake the canvas if necessary.
Frame handles loading Bitmap, Sound, etc. assets by wrapping PreloadJS
See https://zimjs.com/frame.html for sample templates using Frame.

The first frame made is called the zimDefaultFrame - or zdf.
It will also have the default stage for addTo(), center(), etc.
Use setDefault() on another frame to change the default frame.

As of ZIM ZIM 01, ZIM will make F, S, W, H global variables
that reference the zimDefaultFrame, its stage and the stage width and height.
The width and height will be updated in FULL mode if the window size changes.

ZIM ASSET TOOL
See https://zimjs.com/assetlist/
Optionally use this tool to prepare an array of assets from a folder.

CANVAS ALTERNATIVE CONTENT
Frame will move any tag with an id of canvasIDAlternative into the canvas tag.
By default, the canvasID is "myCanvas" so use an id of "myCanvasAlternative".
This allows you to show content for non-canvas browsers.
The content may also be indexed by search engines - one would hope
and is read by screen readers (see also ZIM Accessibility).

NOTE: addTo(), center(), centerReg(), loc(), pos(), new Ticker.add()
default to the stage of the first frame made
use the setDefault() method to set a frame to the default frame

NOTE: here are some tips that relate to Frame:
https://zimjs.com/tips#FRAME
https://zimjs.com/tips#IMAGES
https://zimjs.com/tips#SOUND
https://zimjs.com/tips#FULLSCREEN

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// load assets such as images right in Frame call using a url
// put multiple assets in an array - see assets parameter for options
// the path and progress are optional

new Frame(FIT, 1024, 768, "#ddd", "#333", ready, "image.png", "assets/", new Waiter());
function ready() {

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Pic("image.png").center(); // formerly had used asset("image.png").center();

} // end ready

EXAMPLE
// load assets on-demand inside ready event

new Frame(FIT, 1024, 768, dark, light, ready);
function ready() {

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// code here - or optionally load assets

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.loadAssets("image.png");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.on("complete", ()=&gt;{

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// app code goes here if waiting for assets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var image = new Pic("image.png");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;image.center();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}); // end asset complete

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// OR for multiple assets in an assets folder:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.loadAssets(["sound.mp3", "spriteData.json", "spriteImage.png"], "assets/");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.on("complete", ()=&gt;{

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// app code goes here if waiting for assets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const soundInstance = new Aud("sound.mp3").play(); // formerly asset("sound.mp3").play()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// later soundInstance.paused = true; // etc.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const sprite = new Sprite({json:"spriteData.json"});
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sprite.center().run(2);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// the image for the sprite is specified in the JSON
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// but we still want to load it so it is in the loadAssets()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// and the JSON data will take care of adding it to the sprite

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}); // end asset complete

} // end of ready

EXAMPLE
// lazy-load image - added in ZIM Cat
// this means that the asset is not passed into the Frame in the assets parameter
// and it is not added with loadAssets() but rather just called with asset().

new Frame(FIT, 1024, 768, dark, light, ready); // no assets parameter
function ready() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// lazy-loading will make a container with type "AC" (Asset Container)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// it will store requested transform information
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// such as that the container is supposed to be centered in this case
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// (remember, the dimensions are unknown until the Bitmap is loaded)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// then call loadAssets() behind the scene
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// and add the Bitmap to the container
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// if loading is successful, it will rename the type to "Image"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// then it will use the dimensions to center the container
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Pic("image.jpg").center(); // formerly asset("image.jpg")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// there are many things that can be done to an object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// that need dimensions - ZIM tries to handle these
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// but if there is something obscure like gesture bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// that ZIM may have missed then use conventional loading
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// or try loading with dimensions provided:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Pic("image.jpg", 100, 200).center();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// NOTE: do not lazy-load Sprite images.
}

EXAMPLE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// With multiple loadAsset() calls you can assign the results to a variable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// and use that variable for the events independently
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Warning, each of these will still call a frame complete event
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// so usually you would use one or the other but not both

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const first = F.loadAssets("image.png");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first.on("complete", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const image = new Pic("image.png").center();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const second = F.loadAssets("sound.mp3");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second.on("complete", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const sound = new Aud("sound.mp3").play();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
scaling - (default FULL) can have values as follows
Note: as of ZIM Cat 04, the constant FIT or the string "fit", etc. can be used
FIT      sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit inside window size
FILL     sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fill window size (previously "outside")
FULL     sets stage to window size with no scaling
"tagID"  add canvas to HTML tag of ID - set to dimensions if provided - no scaling

FIT and FILL: width and height will set the stage width and height and the canvas is then scaled
this is handy because all your dimensions are set to start
FULL: width and height are ignored when scaling as these are set to the window width and height
TAG: if width and height are provided then the canvas and stage will be these dimensions
if width and height are not provided in tag mode, the canvas and stage will take the dimensions of the tag
this means, the tag must have some sort of width and height dimensions set or it will be really big!
In this mode, you may need to style the containing tag with CSS to get a desired effect.

width - (default 1024 except for full**) the width of the stage
height - (default 768 except for full**) the height of the stage
** if tag mode and no width or height then these will be the width and height of the tag
color - (default null) the background color of the frame (any CSS value) - or just set in styles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be see-through if not specified
outerColor - (default null) the body color of the HTML page - null will not adjust the background color
ready - (default null) - an callback function for when the Frame is ready - rather than using the "ready" event
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will be passed frame specific (frame, stage, width, height, mobile) parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the stage is updated after this function is called
assets - (default null) - 1. a string asset or 2. an array of assets, 3. ZIM asset object, 4. ZIM multi-asset object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. "logo.png"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. ["logo.png", "bounce.mp3", "Reuben.otf"]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. {id:"string", src:"logo.png", path:"assets/", loadTimeout:2, noCORSonImage:true}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. [{assets:["one.png", "two.png"], path:"images/"}, {assets:["big.mp3", "oof.mp3"], path:"sounds/"}]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** see the loadAssets() method for details - including more file types, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: "complete", "progress" and "fileLoaded" events are not dispatched
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use loadAssets() for these if desired
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the "ready" event will be dispatched when the canvas is ready and initial assets are loaded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: the loadAssets() method can still be used as desired
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: as of ZIM Cat 04, SVG will be automatically converted to a Bitmap with and svg property of the original SVG.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEE: https://zimjs.com/assetlist/ for many files
path - (default null) - a string path for the assets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if an assets object is provide with a path then this parameter is ignored
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will also set the ZIM PATH global to the path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZIM PATH is used with lazy-loaded images (eg. when not using Frame assets parameter or loadAssets() method)
ticker - (default null) - an optional callback function to be added to the ZIM Ticker - rather than using Ticker.add();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will be passed frame specific (count, frame, stage, width, height) parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;count starts at 1 and the stage is updated after this function is called
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see the pauseTicker() method
progress - (default null) - set to a Waiter() or ProgressBar() object to show while loading
rollover - (default true) activates rollovers
touch - (default true) activates touch on mobile - this will be multitouch by default
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to false for no touch on mobile - also see singleTouch parameter to set singleTouch
scrollTop - (default false) activates scrolling on older apple devices to hide the url bar
align - (default CENTER) for FIT and FILL, the horizontal alignment LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT
valign - (default CENTER) for FIT and FILL, the vertical alignment TOP, CENTER, BOTTOM
canvasID - (default "myCanvas" or if subsequent frame, myCanvas+randomID) will be set to tagIDCanvas if a tagID is provided - eg. scaling="test", canvasID="testCanvas"
rollPerSecond - (default 20) times per second rollover is activated (if rollover parameter is true)
delay - (default .03 and 1 for mobile) seconds to resize at load and after orientation change (also see ZIM TIME constant)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some devices are slow to report true width and height
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At loading, mobile will be tested right away and then at .1 seconds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the default is to then test again at the delay (default 1 second)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At resize, mobile will be tested every .05 seconds up to the delay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set this to some other time if desired
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if set to 0 then no additional test will be done - not even the one at .03 seconds
canvasCheck - (default true) check to see if there is canvas support - uses !!window.HTMLCanvasElement
gpu - (default false) set to true to use a CreateJS StageGL stage for GPU renderer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: retina will be turned off if gpu is on otherwise antialiasing really looks bad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See: http://blog.createjs.com/stagegl-faster-better-stronger-webgl-update-easeljs/ (written before version 1 release)
gpuObj - (default null) object with following properties (with defaults) See CreateJS docs on GITHUB:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preserveBuffer (false), antialias (false), transparent (false), premultiply (false), autoPurge (1200)
nextFrame - (default null) set to zim Frame object of Frame underneath current Frame to pass events to nextFrame
nextStage - (default null) alternative to nextFrame if the stage beneath current Frame is not a ZIM Frame but just a CreateJS Stage
allowDefault - (default false - true for tag mode) set to true to allow default mouse, key and scrollwheel events on canvas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See also the zil property of frame that allows you to add and remove these events dynamically (except for mouse swipe scroll and zoom on mobile)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allowDefault of false also sets body overflow to hidden - which is good for full, fit and fill modes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see allowDefault property
loadFailObj - (default result of F.makeCircles) object that shows if asset() does not exist or did not load withing loadTimeout
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be given a type property of "EmptyAsset"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the loadFailObj property below to null to set no object - but this will yield errors unless each resulting asset() is tested
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set to new Container() to show nothing (but avoid errors) - or new Rectangle(10, 10) to show little black square, etc.
sensors - (default false) set to true to capture Frame devicemotion and deviceorientation events - see Events
retina - (default true) scales stage to use pixelDensity (sharper when scaling up) and supports Adobe Animate export
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may need to set mouse event targets to e.stageX/zim.scaX and e.stageY.zim.scaY
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except for using S.getObjectUnderPoint()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZIM overrides CreateJS localToGlobal, globalToLocal and localToLocal to accomodate stage scaling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a major adjustment to transform(), bezier controls, outline, physics, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to false to return to traditional PRE ZIM 10.3.0 unscaled stage
mouseMoveOutside - (default false) set to true to capture mouse movement outside the stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see also mouseX and mouseY properties of frame - these work with ZIM retina without adjusting for stage scale
captureMouse - (default true) set to false to not use stagemousemove event to set F.mouseX and F.mouseY (good with Retina)
shim - (default null) used by ZIM SHIM 2 https://zimjs.com/animate/ to create Frame with pre-existing stage and canvas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accepts an object with stage and canvas properties - lets Adobe handle resize
maxConnections - (default 10) set the maximum number of concurrent connections.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From CreateJS PreloadJS: Note that browsers and servers may have a built-in maximum number of open connections,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so any additional connections may remain in a pending state until the browser opens the connection.
maxNum - for sound this is how many instances of the sound can play at once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also can set in asset object maxNum property and loadAssets() and asset() maxNum parameters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see sound interrupt parameter
singleTouch - set to true for single touch rather than the default multitouch (or touch false)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will override the touch setting to turn touch to true

METHODS
loadAssets(assets, path, progress, xhr, time, loadTimeout, outputAudioSprite, crossOrigin, fileType, queueOnly, maxConnections, maxNum)  |ZIM DUO| also accepts ZIM DUO configuration object as single parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// see also assets and path parameters of Frame - which share the info below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// see https://zimjs.com/assetlist/ to get an array of many files
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assets - a file (url String, asset object or multi-asset object) or files in an Array
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each asset String is how you then access the asset with the asset() method of Frame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asset types (from CreateJS PreloadJS): Image, Font, JSON, Sound, SVG, Text, XML&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: as of ZIM ZIM 02, fonts can be loaded with just the font file name (including Google Fonts) rather than a ZIM font object - see FONTS in the Docs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: as of ZIM Cat 04, SVG will be automatically converted to a Bitmap with and svg property of the original SVG.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asset can also be a ZIM asset object:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{id:"string", src:"filename", path:"dir/", loadTimeout:1, maxNum:num, noCORSonImage:true}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then can use the id to access the asset in the asset() method of Frame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filename will be added to an overall path if a path parameter is provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or overwritten with a local path if a path property is provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an asset object with a filename of an absolute filename starting with http will ignore path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loadTimeout (default 8) will override the loadAssets() loadTimeout
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is how many seconds to wait for asset before error and a complete fires even though asset not loaded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maxNum (browser default) is used with sound to specify the maximum number of sounds of the same source to play at one time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can be used with the interrupt parameter of the play() method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to ignore multiple sounds or start the sound over again instead of playing multiple versions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;noCORSonImage (default false) set to true to make an HTML img tag and read it into a ZIM Bitmap to avoid CORS testing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it then uses ZIM expand(0) to add a CreateJS hitArea to the Bitmap allowing it to be interactive and avoid CORS
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thanks Disco for the technique
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: this means the Bitmap will be interactive everywhere - not just in opaque areas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: loading images this way will not count as progress (bytes loaded ratio) in the progress event but do count for fileloaded and complete events
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asset can be a ZIM multi-asset object {assets:[], path:"dir/", loadTimeout:1, maxNum:num, noCORSonImage:true}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where the array can hold multiple files that will have the provided properties applied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is handy for loading assets from multiple directories (added in ZIM Cat 02 - thanks Netanela for the prompting)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{assets:["one.png", "two.png"], path:"images/"},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{assets:["big.mp3", "oof.mp3"], path:"sounds/"}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** warning - if an asset has the same name as a previous asset, then the later asset id will have the path added to its id
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** for example:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{assets:["one.png", "two.png"], path:"images/"},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{assets:["one.png", "man.png"], path:"portraits/"}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** then asset("one.png") will be the asset in the images folder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** and asset("portraits/one.png") will be the asset in the portraits folder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asset can also be a font object - but as of ZIM ZIM 02, fonts can be loaded with just the file name, including Google Fonts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DO NOT use uppercase letters on mobile apps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{font:name, src:url, type:string, weight:string, style:string} // with last three properties being optional
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{font: "wildwood", src:"ChurchintheWildwood-Regular.ttf", type:"OpenType"} // type is not needed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{font: "regu", src:"regul-bold.woff", weight:"bold"}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{src:"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto"}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For google fonts https://fonts.google.com/ you add extra information to the url so the font (family), type, weight and style are ignored
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If absolute src is used, path parameter is ignored - otherwise path is added to start of src
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After loading, can just use:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var label = new Label("hello", 30, "wildwood") // or whatever the font property is
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asset can be an AudioSprite - which is a single sound file and data for sounds within the sound file:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZIM has a format for the data and so does CreateJS - there is also the parseAudioSprite() method for importing formats
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the parseAudioSound parameter to pre-parse the ZIM format then use the resulting CreateJS format to avoid live parsing (maybe save a millisecond)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZIM FORMAT:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{src:"audiosprite.mp3", audioSprite:[
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                // [id, startime(s), endtime(s)]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                // prefer this when making audioSprites by hand in Premiere or Audition
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                ['blackball', 1.041, 2.475],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                ['bounce', 3.567, 4.232]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CREATEJS FORMAT:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{src: "audiosprite.mp3", data:{ // extra data property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    audioSprite: [
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        {id:"sound1", startTime:0, duration:500}, // time in ms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        {id:"sound2", startTime:1000, duration:400},

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See also previewAudioSprite() method in the META section of docs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;path - pass in an optional path String that gets prepended to the asset
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when accessing the asset with the asset() method you do NOT include the path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assets with an absolute URL (http[s]://etc.) will ignore path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will also set the ZIM PATH global to the path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZIM PATH is used with lazy-loaded images (eg. when not using Frame assets parameter or loadAssets() method)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;progress - (default null) - set to a Waiter() or ProgressBar() object to show while loading
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;xhr (default true) the loading method for files - perhaps will need to set to false in some cases (WEBP alternative from Cloudflare, etc.)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time (default 0) is the minimum number of seconds for the complete event to trigger
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use this for testing or to always have time to show a loading message
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loadTimeout (default 8) is how many seconds to wait for asset before error and a complete fires even though asset not loaded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outputAudioSprite (default false) set to true when passing in a ZIM AudioSprite format to output to the console a CreateJS AudioSprite JSON object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JSON.parse() this object before passing in to loadAssets() - and add single quotes around console output as those are stripped by console
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crossOrigin (default "anonymous") - leave at default to load from Amazon S3, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had to add &lt;AllowedMethod&gt;HEAD&lt;/AllowedMethod&gt; in CORSRule of CORS configuration on Amazon S3 for fonts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html#how-do-i-enable-cors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/header-caching.html#header-caching-web-cors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and had to edit distribution behaviours for cache header &gt; whitelist and move over Origin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: this will still not get past CORS if there is no CORS provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see noCORSonImage property of ZIM asset object for an image solution to bypass CORS
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fileType (default null) in cases where the file type cannot be parsed or is parsed incorrectly, this overrides
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might have to split up loading as this fileType gets applied to all files loaded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Types are for CreateJS PreloadJS: https://www.createjs.com/docs/preloadjs/classes/LoadQueue.html
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    createjs.Types.BINARY: Raw binary data via XHR
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    createjs.Types.CSS: CSS files
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    createjs.Types.IMAGE: Common image formats
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    createjs.Types.JAVASCRIPT: JavaScript files
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    createjs.Types.JSON: JSON data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    createjs.Types.JSONP: JSON files cross-domain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    createjs.Types.MANIFEST: A list of files to load in JSON format, see AbstractLoader/loadManifest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    createjs.Types.SOUND: Audio file formats
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    createjs.Types.SPRITESHEET: JSON SpriteSheet definitions. This will also load sub-images, and provide a SpriteSheet instance.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    createjs.Types.SVG: SVG files
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    createjs.Types.TEXT: Text files - XHR only
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    createjs.Types.VIDEO: Video objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    createjs.Types.XML: XML data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;queueOnly (default false) - set to true to send events only to the Queue object (see below) rather than the Frame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when using queues to accept events, remember that the frame also receives events
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you also have some general frame events for loading, set this parameter to true to avoid accident
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maxConnections - (default the Frame maxConnections) set the maximum number of concurrent connections.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From CreateJS PreloadJS: Note that browsers and servers may have a built-in maximum number of open connections,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so any additional connections may remain in a pending state until the browser opens the connection.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maxNum - for sound this is how many instances of the sound can play at once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see sound play() interrupt parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RETURNS: a Queue object that can be used for control with multiple loadAssets calls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Queue will trigger progress, assetload and complete events
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Queue will have a preload property to the CreateJS LoadQueue and an isLoading property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frame also has these events and properties but acts for all loading - so be careful - see the queueOnly parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recommended to use the Queue any time you use multiple LoadAssets() calls at the same time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You still access assets with asset() as outlined below whether you use the Queue or not
asset(file, width, height, maxNum) - access an asset such as an image or sound - see loadAssets() for more on types
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;file is the string name or url to the file&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the asset was loaded with a string then use the string (less the path if provided)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the asset was loaded with a full URL then use the full URL here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the asset uses an asset object with an id then use the id
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;file can be a |ZIM VEE| value so for instance, an array and asset will pick randomly - or a series, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** warning, if the assets are loaded with ZIM Multi-asset Objects with assets and path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** and an asset has the same name as a previous asset, then the later asset id will have the path added to its id
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width and height will help the auto-loading (lazy-loading) otherwise, ZIM will recall positioning applied before the asset is loaded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** otherwise there is no need to add a width and height - only do so to optionally help auto-loading
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maxNum - for sound this is how many instances of the sound can play at once - also see sound play() interrupt parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** asset() is available as a global function asset() or if zns (ZIM name space) is true then as zim.asset()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** if there are two or more frames, then use F.asset() not asset()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** traditionally, these have been preloaded into the Frame asset parameter or with Frame loadAssets()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** As of ZIM Cat, using asset() without preloading will automatically load the asset - thanks Ami Hanya for suggestion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   this works only for images and sound and should be used sparingly as each asset has its own preloading
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   and some things like sprite assets may have issues.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** As of ZIM ZIM, there is a ZIM PATH constant that can be used to set the path for automatic loading (lazy-loading)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   see the docs under ZIM PATH for details
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** asset() will add "complete" and "assetLoad" event to the asset object&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the asset is an image then this is a Bitmap which can be added to the stage, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the asset is a sound then use asset(file).play();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;play has ZIM DUO params of volume, loop, loopCount, pan, offset, delay, interrupt
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see the ZIM Docs on Sound (below the Frame) for param information
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the asset is anything else, then it is what it is!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asset() will have a type property depending on what type (except JSON, XML and text which are just the object itself)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for instance, an image will have type "Bitmap" as it is a ZIM Bitmap object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a lazy-loaded image will have type "Image" as it is actually a Container holding a Bitmap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its Bitmap can be accessed with the bitmap property - so asset("auto.png").bitmap will access the Bitmap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a lazy-loaded sound will have type "Sound"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asset.getIDs() will return an array of asset IDs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zim.assets is an object literal that holds all the assets based on ID
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider this to be read only
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is the object that the asset() function calls so usually just use asset()
object(name) - get a DisplayObject (for example a Circle or Button) by its name.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** object() is available as a global function object() or if zns (ZIM name space) is true then as zim.object()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DisplayObjects do not start with a name but can be named if desired. Usually, we use variable names to reference an object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the DisplayObject name property and the nam() short chainable method to set a name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;object.getNames() will return an array of object names that have been set.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any object that is named the same name as another object will overwrite the other object and will not be in the object() list anymore
follow(obj, boundary, damp, dampY, leftOffset, rightOffset, upOffset, downOffset, offsetDamp, offsetDampY, horizontal, vertical, borderLock, lag) |ZIM DUO|
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moves obj container to keep provided object in middle of stage view
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass in null for obj to stop following
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See https://zimjs.com/ten/follow.html - with keys
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See https://codepen.io/danzen/pen/gNKQYY - with press
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj - the Display Object to follow - works well if controlling obj with ZIM Motion Controller (mousedown, keydown, gamebutton, gamestick)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unlike Physics follow() the obj for Frame follow() must be in a container - the container will be moved
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boundary - (default stage size) - or use a ZIM Boundary() object to specify x, y, width and height to keep obj inside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see also followBoundary property of Frame to update this boundary in a frame "resize" event function when frame is in "full" scaling mode
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;damp - (default .05) the damping of the motion - 1 moves faster, 0 not at all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dampY - (default damp) can set to damp vertical movement at a separate rate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leftOffset - (default 0 from left of boundary)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rightOffset - (default 0 from right of boundary) - differs from Physics follow which is distance from 0 to right offset
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   the object will try and move to leftOffset when moving right and rightOffset when moving left
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   this counters the damping so that the user can see in the direction of motion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   when the object is not being controled it moves to the average between left and right offsets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upOffSet - (default 0 from top of boundary)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;downOffSet - (default 0 from bottom of boundary)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   same as offsets above but in the y direction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offsetDamp - (default .02) the damping for moving the object to the offset
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offsetDampY - (default offsetDamp) - damping for moving the object to the y offset if desired to be different than x
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal - (default true) set to false to not follow horizontally
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vertical - (default true) set to false to not follow vertically
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;borderLock - (default false) set to true to stop container at boundary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lag - (default false) set to true to position object back from direction of motion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this gives more view as moving but sort of goes in two directions when motion stops
setDefault() - sets the frame to be the default frame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by default ;=) the default frame is the first frame made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the default frame has the stage that addTo(), center(), etc. will use as the default container
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a global varible called zdf is also available
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as of ZIM ZIM 01, global variables F, S, W, H are provided for frame, stage, width and height of the default frame
keyboardMessage(color, backgroundColor, message, response, percent) |ZIM DUO| - place a message to press screen for keyboard control
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;works with iFrames as well to avoid having to press outside the canvas on the iframe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it does this by turning off the canvas pointer events until the iframe is pressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color defaults to yellow, backgroundColor to black
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;update the message and the response once pressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;percent defaults to 80% the stage width
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns the label if repositioning is desired
fullscreen(mode) - set Frame to HTML fullscreen - mode defaults to true - set to false to come out of fullscreen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see isFullscreen property and two fullscreen events
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: this is nothing to do with "full" scaling mode but rather the Browser window F11 fullscreen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see: https://zimjs.com/expand to go from ZIM "tag" scaling mode to ZIM "fit" scaling mode
makeCat(height) - returns a ZIM Cat icon - provide height rather than scaling for better caching if cached
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if mobile, the icon will be cached - can uncache() it if desired
makeIcon(edges, box, slats, borderColor, borderWidth) |ZIM DUO| - returns a ZIM Z icon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;edges defaults to zim.light and is the top and bottom line in the Z
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;box defaults to zim.dark and is the background box color
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slats defaults to the ZIM colors but can be set to any array of five colors (setting true will set to zim.silver)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;borderColor and borderWidth default to null - or borderWidth 1 if color set and borderColor black if borderWidth set
madeWith(color, text, edges, box, slats, borderColor, borderWidth) |ZIM DUO| - returns a ZIM Z icon with Made With message
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color - (default zim.dark) change color of text (pass in clear to hide text)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text - (default: "Made with ZIM") change to desired made with message
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other parameters see makeIcon() above
makeCircles(radius, multiple) - returns ZIM Circles (centered reg)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;radius defaults to 100
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multiple defaults to false which will return a ZIM Shape - set to true to return a ZIM Container of ZIM Circles
remakeCanvas(width, height) - removes old canvas and makes a new one and a new stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will have to set your local stage, W and H variables again
update() - call this if frame position is moved on the HTML page
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for instance, when a div to left has its display style set to none and the frame shifts over
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calling update() will dispatch an update event to any TextArea, Loader or Tag objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so they resize properly with the new F.x and F.y values
dispose() - removes canvas, resize listener and stage

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
stage - read only reference to the zim Stage - to change run remakeCanvas()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frame gives the stage read only S.width and S.height properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frame gives the stage a frame property that points to the frame that made the stage
canvas - a reference to the frame's canvas tag
canvasID - a reference to the frame's canvas ID
color - the color of the frame background - any css color
outerColor - the color of the body of the HTML page - set with styles
scaling - holds the scaling mode - FULL, FIT, FILL (or "full", "fit", "fill"), "tag" or "inline"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tag is tag mode with no dimensions and inline is tag mode with dimensions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see the tag property below if mode is tag or inline
tag - the containing tag if scaling is set to an HTML tag id (else null)
isDefault - a Boolean to indicate whether the Frame is the default frame (see setDefault() method)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the default frame has the stage that addTo(), center(), etc. will use as the default container
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a global varible called zdf is also available
isLoading - a Boolean to indicate whether loadAssets() is currently loading assets (also, each queue has an isLoading property)
isFullscreen - a Boolean to indicate if Frame is in HTML fullscreen mode - see fullscreen() method and events
width - read only reference to the stage width - to change run remakeCanvas()
height - read only reference to the stage height - to change run remakeCanvas()
scale - read only returns the scale of the canvas - will return 1 for full and tag scale modes
mouseX, mouseY - read only value of the mouse x and y positions on the canvas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: the frame captureMouse parameter must be set to true (default)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: this value includes the division by the stage scale needed for ZIM Retina
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whereas getting the mouse coordinates from a mouse event object does not include division by the stage scale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set frame's mouseMoveOutside parameter to true to capture movement outside the canvas
cursors - get or set an object literal with custom cursors to override the CSS cursors or act on their own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See: https://zimjs.com/014/cursors.html
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the format is:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.cursors = {default:DisplayObject, pointer:DisplayObject, madeUp:DisplayObject, etc.}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: use the cur() method to set cursors - DO NOT use the cursor property to set cursors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drag(), tap(), etc. will already work with the custom cursor system
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set F.cursors = null to turn off custom cursors
cursorsExclude - object or [objects] not to get custom cursors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: the cur() must be set on the object for the exclude to work
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the cur() is set on an object inside a container then the exclude must be set manually (after F.cursor is set)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;innerObject.cursor = "default"; // or "pointer", etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;innerObject._cursor = null; // clear custom cursor flag
cursorObj - the current custom cursor object
cursorList - a Dictionary that holds data for cursors - used internally to keep track of custom cursors
cursorTypes - an array of valid CSS cursors - used internally to watch for invalid CSS cursors if name used is not in cursors
leftMouseDown - read only value as to whether the left mouse button is down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used internally by drag and others to make sure pressup on iFrames is handled when the mouse comes back on the stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see "mouseupplus" event
mousedownEvent - a reference to the frame "stagemousedown" event - can set F.off("stagemousedown", F.mousedownEvent)
mousemoveEvent - a reference to the frame "stagemousemove" event - can set F.off("stagemousemove", F.mousemoveEvent)
orientation - VERTICAL or HORIZONTAL (updated live with orientation change)
visibleLeft, visibleTop, visibleRight, visibleBottom - in "fill" scale mode these give window edge locations relative to the stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be used to position items like navigation relative to window as the frame resize event is fired
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in all scale modes other than "fill", the values are 0, W, 0, H
zil - reference to zil events that stop canvas from shifting or scrolling - also see allowDefaults parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can set allowDefault property to false then allow specific defaults by removing zil events - see zil global function
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;example: window.removeEventListener("keydown", F.zil[0]); removes keydown preventions (for page up, page down, home, end, etc)
allowDefault - set to true to remove zil or false to set zil (see above) also affects body overflow
colors: orange, green, pink, blue, brown, yellow, red, purple, silver, tin, grey, lighter, moon, light, dark, darker, white, black, clear (0 alpha), faint (.01 alpha)
followBoundary - update with a ZIM Boundary for follow() if "full" mode Frame "resize" event happens, etc.
altKey - true if the alt key is being pressed otherwise false
ctrlKey - true if the ctrl key is being pressed otherwise false
metaKey - true if the meta key (âŒ˜ command on Mac or âŠž windows key) is being pressed otherwise false
shiftKey - true if the shift key is being pressed otherwise false
loadFailObj - the object that shows if images are broken - will be given a type property of "EmptyAsset"
startTime - datestamp of when frame was made - used internally
retina - read-only Boolean as to whether stage (as opposed to the canvas) was scaled for pixelDensity during Frame creation

ALSO see F, S, W, H, M global variables which reference the default frame, its stage and width and height, and if on mobile

EVENTS
"ready" - fired when the stage is made (and state update will be called after dispatched) - also see ready parameter
"failed" - fired if no canvas support (and canvasCheck parameter is set to true - which is the default)
"resize" - fired on resize of screen
"update" - fired when F.update() is called - read by Loader, TextArea and Tag objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: this is for when the frame is moved within an html page
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for instance, when a div to the left has its display set to none - then call F.update();
"orientation" - fired on orientation change
"contextmenu" - fired on right click
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to prevent the default right click then use
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.preventDefault() in your event function.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see https://zimjs.com/explore/contextmenu.html
"keydown" - fired on keydown - just like the window keydown event with eventObject.keyCode, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also stores F.altKey, F.ctrlKey, F.metaKey, F.shiftKey
"keyup" - fired on keyup - just like the window keyup event with eventObject.keyCode, etc.
"mouseupplus" - fired when the browser window receives a mouseup event
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also fired when the mouse enters the stage from an iFrame and is no longer down.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note there is no eventObject.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALSO see mouseupplusonly for only firing as mouse enters the stage from an iFrame and is no longer down.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouseup, pressup, stagemouseup, etc. do not work when the mouse is up over an iframe or outside an iframe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZIM drag() makes use of this event to stop the drag if the mouse was up over an iframe or outside the an iframe holding the canvas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This could have been done with setting events on parent windows but this runs into CORS errors in many cases
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This event fires on the bubbling phase so can be ignored if a real press up is in place - for instance:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;record a check variable as true when mousedown and false when pressup which also calls an up function.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a mouseupplus event function, activate the up function only if the check variable is still true.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will call the up function as the mouse comes back onto the stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the mouse was down when leaving the stage and let up outside the iframe the canvas is in - goodness.
"mouseuplusonly" - fired when the mouse comes back from an iframe (not holding the canvas)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the mouse was down on the canvas and up in the iframe.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this does not fire on a regular mouseup whereas the mouseupplus will.
"wheel" - fired on mousewheel (Window wheel event)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can get eventObject.deltaX and eventObject.deltaY
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these vary greatly in value based on Browser
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may want to just ask for sign(eventObject.deltaY) and multiply it by a factor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then perhaps constrain the value - here the scale is constrained between .5 and 5
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note - when changing scale, it is better to multiply by a factor rather than add to the scale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. circle.scale = constrain(circle.scale*(sign(e.deltaY)&gt;0?.75:1.25), .5, 5);
"deviceorientation" - MUST SET Frame sensors parameter to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fired as device orientation changes:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eventObject.rotation.x (beta in HTML specs) holds rotation about the x axis between -180 and 180 (tipped forward or backward)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eventObject.rotation.y (gamma in HTML specs) holds rotation about the y axis between -90 and 90 (tipped left or right)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eventObject.rotation.z (alpha in HTML specs) holds rotation about the z axis 0-360 clockwise (relative to orientation when app loads)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note rotation.z is 360-alpha compared to the HTML 5 specs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note also that beta, gamma and alpha from the HTML 5 specs are also provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var label = new Label().center();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.on("deviceorientation", function(e) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;label.text = e.rotation.x +","+ e.rotation.y +","+ e.rotation.z;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
"devicemotion" - MUST SET Frame sensors parameter to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fired on moving mobile device - like a tilt or shake - eventObject.acceleration holds x, y and z properties of motion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var label = new Label().center();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.on("devicemotion", function(e) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;label.text = e.acceleration.x +","+ e.acceleration.y +","+ e.acceleration.z;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
"fullscreenenter" - dispatched going into fullscreen - see fullscreen() method
"fullscreenexit" - dispatched if coming out of fullscreen - see fullscreen(false) method
"tabfocus" - dispatched when tab gains focus - only dispatched by the zdf (ZIM Default Frame)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZIM setBlurDetect() is now activated by Frame and used by ZIM in animate(), timeout(), interval(), wiggle()
"tabblur" - dispatched when tab loses focus - only dispatched by the zdf (ZIM Default Frame)

ASSET EVENTS
loadAssets() will trigger these events on the Frame object and on the specific queue (eg. var queue = F.loadAssets();)
NOTE: if loadAssets() queueOnly parameter is true, then only the queue receives the events - see queueOnly parameter
"progress" - fires constantly as assets are loaded with loadAssets() to represent overall load progress (fonts not included)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The event object has a progress property between 0 and 1
"assetload" - fired when an asset loaded with loadAssets() or asset() has loaded (use asset property of event object to get its file and src) (fonts not included)
"complete" - fired when all assets loaded with loadAssets() or asset() are loaded
"error" - fired when there is a problem loading an asset with loadAssets()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the assets are loaded in the Frame then the error event must be captured outside the ready event
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and if loadAssets() or lazy-load with asset() are used then the error event must be captured outside the complete event&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

[79591] Pic(file, width, height, noCors, style, group, inherit)

Pic
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Use Pic() to show an image, such as a jpg, png, webp, etc.
There may be a security error when loading images locally for any Canvas app.
Please read https://zimjs.com/tips.html#IMAGES for easy solutions.

Before ZIM version ZIM 00, asset() or F.asset() was used to show images.
These can still be used if desired. The Pic() class just wraps the asset() call.

SEE: https://zimjs.com/zim/assets.html

PRELOADING
It is recommended that you preload images (along with sounds, etc.) using the Frame() assets and path parameters.
Batch loading images is more efficient and the width and height will be available when the Frame() is "ready" or loadAssets() is "complete".
Images can also be loaded on demand with F.loadAssets() at any time - for instance, for a second section of the app.

LAZY-LOADING
If images are not preloaded then Pic() will use automatic loading (lazy-loading).
If width and height are provided, all will go smoothly.
If width and height are not provided, ZIM will store various scaling and positioning commands
and re-apply the commands once the images are loaded.
This happens for center(), centerReg(), pos(), scaleTo(), outline() and perhaps others.
This extra work is NOT required if assets are preloaded or a width and height are provided.
Some controls like Tile() and Scroller() must have dimensions and will give a warning in the console.
In the past there has been issues with cloning lazy-loaded images before they are loaded, but this should work now.

Pic will give a "ready" and a "complete" event when loaded.
These events are triggered 20 ms after making the object if the object is already preloaded.

NOTE: Pic is a container with a bitmap inside (see bitmap property).
This means that other objects can be added to the Pic object.
This is like the ZIM Shapes (Rectangle, Circle, etc.) which are containers and can have objects added to them.
If doing this, note that the container has its mouseChildren turned off
so when dragging, for instance, the whole pic moves rather than the bitmap inside the pic.
To interact with objects inside, set pic.mouseChildren = true.
Generally, for clarity, avoid adding objects to Shapes or Pics unless you are used to the mouseChildren setting.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// lazy-load an image in the same directory
new Pic("image.png").center();

// NOTE: the above may give a CORS security error locally
// to easily solve this see https://zimjs.com/tips.html#IMAGES

EXAMPLE
// lazy-load an image in the assets/ directory
new Pic("assets/image.png").center();

EXAMPLE
// lazy-load an image in the assets/ directory using PATH constant
PATH = "assets/"
new Pic("image.png").center();

EXAMPLE
// preload the image in the Frame along with path parameter
new Frame(FIT, 1024, 768, light, grey, ready, "image.png", "assets/");
function ready() {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Pic("image.png").center(); // adds the preloaded assets/image.png
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// the PATH would be set to "assets/" by the Frame path parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Pic("sky.png").addTo(); // would lazy-load assets/sky.png
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PATH = "people/";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Pic("laura.png").addTo(); // would lazy-load people/laura.png
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Pic("peter.png").addTo(); // would lazy-load people/peter.png
}

EXAMPLE
// preload all the images above
// the first two will use the path parameter
// the other two are in a different directory so can use an assets object {} with a different path
const assets = ["image.png", "sky.png", {assets:["laura.png", "peter.png"], path:"people/"}];
const path = "assets/";
new Frame(FIT, 1024, 768, light, grey, ready, assets, path);
function ready() {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Pic("image.png").center(); // adds the preloaded assets/image.png
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Pic("sky.png").addTo(); // adds the preloaded assets/sky.png
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Pic("laura.png").addTo(); // adds the preloaded people/laura.png
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Pic("peter.png").addTo(); // adds the preloaded people/peter.png
}

// alternatively the path could have been added to each asset:
assets = ["assets/image.png", "assets/sky.png", "people/laura.png", "people/peter.png"];
// this would be passed into Frame along with no path parameter
// and the assets would then be accessed in the ready event with the path included:
new Pic("asset/image.png").center();

EXAMPLE
const plates = ["plate1.png", "plate2.png", "plate3.png"];
// lazy-load random plate pictures in a Tile

// below would be broken with a warning in the console
// because the tile does not know the plate dimensions
new Tile(new Pic(plates), 4, 4).center();

// below would work because the dimensions of 200, 200 were provided
// however, if the plates are not actually 200,200 then it may look wrong
new Tile(new Pic(plates, 200, 200), 4, 4).center();

// below would work because preloading in Frame() or loadAssets() provides real dimensions
// when the tile is made, the dimensions are known
const load = F.loadAssets(plates);
load.on("complete", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Tile(new Pic(plates), 4, 4).center();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
file - |ZIM VEE| the String file name of the image including file extension for instance, "pic.png"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a global PATH constant that can be set to add a path to the start of the file name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for instance setting PATH = "assets/" would then look for "assets/pic.png".
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a path is provided to Frame() parameter or the loadAssets() then these will automatically set the global PATH constant.
width - (default null) optionally predict the width of the image
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The width will be ignored and the actual width will be used if the image is preloaded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and if lazy-loaded, the width will be replaced with the actual width after the image is loaded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the width is only used to tell something like a Tile(), what size to expect before the image is loaded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To change the width of a Pic, use siz() or sca() methods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or width, widthOnly, height, heightOnly, scale, scaleX and scaleY properties.
height - (default null) optionally predict the height of the image (see width for similar details)
noCors - (default false) set to true to attempt to bypass CORS (cross origin resource sharing) issues.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CORS errors may show up when loading images from other servers that do not have settings saying this is allowed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting noCors to true will try and load the image with a proxy server https://cors.zimjs.com/ so use sparingly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is better to try and load the images from your own server or get CORS permissions from the server.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not preload the image with this setting - or preload using an asset object with noCORSonImage:true set.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noCors setting will use image() rather than asset()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these solutions use https://cors.zimjs.com/https://theurltotheasset.jpg
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
keyOut(color, tolerance, replacement) - remove a certain color in the picture and make it see-through - with a color tolerance between 0-1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the default color is "#389b26" which is a medium dark green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the default tolerance is .1 - the higher the tolerance the less sensitive the keying process - so more colors will be removed similar to the provided color
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color and tolerance can be an array of colors and tolerances (or just one tolerance if all are the same)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replacement (default clear) a color to replace the keyed out color with or an optional array to match the colors array if an array is used
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:
on(), off(), getBounds(), setBounds(), uncache(), updateCache(), dispatchEvent(),
addChild(), removeChild(), addChildAt(), getChildAt(), contains(), removeAllChildren(), etc.

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in this case the type is "Pic" but if the Pic is lazy-loaded then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it starts as type "AC" (Asset Container) if no dimensions are provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or "ACWD" (Asset Container With Dimensions) until the image is loaded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at which point, the type is set to "Pic"
bitmap - reference the the ZIM Bitmap (picture) inside the Pic container
file - the filename used
src - the source with path and filename - available on complete event
image - the HTML image tag - available on complete event
item - the CreateJS data item used for preload - available on complete event

ALSO: see ZIM Container for properties such as:
width, height, widthOnly, heightOnly, draggable, level, depth, group
blendMode, hue, saturation, brightness, contrast, etc.

ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container properties, such as:
x, y, rotation, scaleX, scaleY, regX, regY, skewX, skewY,
alpha, cursor, shadow, name, mouseChildren, mouseEnabled, parent, numChildren, etc.

EVENTS
dispatches a "complete" and a "ready" event (use either one) when the image is loaded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if preloaded this is dispatched 20 ms after the Pic is made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
See the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container events such as:
added, click, dblclick, mousedown, mouseout, mouseover, pressdown (ZIM), pressmove, pressup, removed, rollout, rollover


************************************
[79851] Aud(file, volume, loop, loopCount, pan, offset, delay, interrupt, maxNum, style, group, inherit)

Aud
zim class - extends a createjs.EventDispatcher

DESCRIPTION
Use Aud() to play a sound with its play() method.
The app must be interacted with before a sound can be played.
There may be a security error when loading sounds locally for any Canvas app.
Please read https://zimjs.com/tips.html#SOUND for easy solutions.

Multiple instances of a sound can be played from the same Aud() object.
When a sound is played it returns an object that can be used to change that specific instance.
Use that object to change the volume, pan, to find out if the sound has looped or is complete
or to pause() or stop() the sound.

Before ZIM version ZIM 00, asset() or F.asset() was used to play sounds.
These can still be used if desired. The Aud() class just wraps the asset() call.

SEE: https://zimjs.com/zim/assets.html

PRELOADING
It is recommended that you preload sounds (along with images, etc.) using the Frame() assets and path parameters.
After the frame loads, sounds can also be loaded on demand with F.loadAssets().
Batch loading sounds is more efficient and the sound will be ready when the Frame() is "ready" or loadAssets() is "complete".

LAZY-LOADING
If sounds are not preloaded then Aud() will use automatic loading (lazy-loading).

Aud will give a "ready" event when loaded.
This event is triggered 20 ms after making the object if the object is already preloaded.
The "complete" event is used for when the sound is finished playing (not finished loading).

AUDIOSPRITE
An AudioSprite can alternatively be used which has many sounds in one sound file.
There is data that goes with the AudioSprite to match a label to a time and duration.
See the Frame docs under loadAssets() method although they can be loaded in the Frame as well.
See also parseAudioSprite() and previewAudioSprite() functions in META section of Docs.

NOTE: The sound can be made at any time but the app must be interacted with before the sound can be played.
This is a general Browswer rule to stop being bombarded with sounds.
It means that you will have to make a start button or a splash page
that the user clicks or taps before a background sound can be played.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// There may be a security error when loading sounds locally for any Canvas app.
// Please read https://zimjs.com/tips.html#SOUND for easy solutions.

const click = new Aud("click.mp3");  // lazy-load a click sound
S.on("stagemousedown", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;click.play(); // plays everytime the stage is clicked (sigh)
});

EXAMPLE
// make a backing sound but do not play it
// the user must first interact at least once with a mousedown/click/tap/change
const backing = new Aud({file:"backing.mp3", loop:true});

let backingSound; // this will store the sound that is playing
// make a Toggle button that starts toggled off
new Toggle({label:"SOUND"})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.sca(.7)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.pos(30,30,LEFT,BOTTOM)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.change(e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// play the sound if it has not played
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// and toggle the instance's paused property if it has been played
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (!backingSound) backingSound = backing.play();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else backingSound.paused = !e.target.toggled;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

EXAMPLE
// preload a couple sounds from an assets/ directory (path)
new Frame(FIT, 1024, 768, light, dark, ready, ["sound.mp3", "backing.mp3"], "assets/");
function ready() {

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// show a Pane() to start so we know user has interacted before we play sounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Pane("START GAME", yellow).show(init); // this calls init when closed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function init() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// now the user has interacted to close the pane&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Aud("backing.mp3", .3, true).play(); // volume of .3 and looping
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Make sounds only play once and start over when pressed again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// otherwise, the default is play the sound completely each press.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// If someone presses a lot - this is a lot of sounds playing at once.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// If we left the interrupt at "none" the sound would finish before playing again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// which is not optimal as we want the sound to start each time we press.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// We could add these to the Aud() parameters but here we use STYLE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STYLE = {maxNum:1, interrupt:"any"}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const sound = new Aud("sound.mp3");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Circle().center().tap(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sound.play();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} // end init()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
} // end frame ready

EXAMPLE
// lazy-load a sound from a PATH of "assets/"
PATH = "assets/"
const long = new Aud("long.mp3");

// press on the stage - note the true for once at end of event
S.on("stagemousedown", ()=&gt;{

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const sound = long.play({volume:.2});

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// adjust the sound after...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timeout(2, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sound.volume = 1;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timeout(4, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sound.paused = true;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timeout(6, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sound.paused = false;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sound.on("complete", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.color = red;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// lazy-load a woot sound from path of assets/ and play twice
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Aud("woot.wav").play({loopCount:2});
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

}, null, true); // true for once then remove the event

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
file - |ZIM VEE| the String file name of the sound including file extension for instance, "sound.mp3"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a global PATH constant that can be set to add a path to the start of the file name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for instance setting PATH = "assets/" would then look for "assets/sound.mp3".
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a path is provided to Frame() parameter or the loadAssets() then these will automatically set the global PATH constant.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an audioSprite use the label here.
** ALL THE PARAMETERS below can also be specified in the play() method (except for maxNum)
volume (default 1) - set the volume
loop (default false) - set to true to loop forever or a number based on loopCount
loopCount (default null) - change to how many times to play the sound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is no need to set loop if loopCount is set
pan (default 0) - set towards -1 to pan left and towards 1 to pan right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may not work locally but should work on server
offset (default 0) - elapsed time in seconds to start playing
delay (default 0) - time to wait before sound is started
interrupt (default "none") - how to interrupt a sound if a sound with the same source is played
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the maximum number of instances of the sound are already playing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** must have maxNum set - see the maxNum property or the Frame(), loadAssets() or asset() maxNum parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"none" - do not interrupt the previously playing sound(s) (with the same source)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"early" - interrupt only the previously playing sound that has progressed the least
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"late" - interrupt only the previously playing sound that has progressed the most
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** thank you CreateJS and SoundJS for providing these options
maxNum (default null) set to a number of instances that a sound can play.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The default is as many as the browser can handle (hundreds).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maxNum can also be set as Frame(), loadAssets() and asset() parameters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting this to 1 will only play one instance of the sound at a time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The interrupt setting determines what happens if the sound is played again while it is playing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if "none" is set (default) then it will not interrupt the current instance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if "any" is set then it will play the sound again from the start, etc.
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

ABSTRACT SOUND INSTANCE
The return result of the play() makes a CreateJS AbstractSoundInstance
var sound = Aud("sound.mp3").play(); // sound is an AbstractSoundInstance
// note: if lazy-loaded then the result of a play() before the sound has loaded
// will be a proxy object with only volume and pan properties and will dispatch a complete event
// methods, other properties and events will only be available on a play() after the sound is loaded

METHODS (of AbstractSoundInstance)
** full docs here: https://www.createjs.com/docs/soundjs/classes/AbstractSoundInstance.html
stop() - stops the sound and sets the time to 0
play() - plays the sound again - usually, the sound is already playing from the sound.play()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but if it is stopped - this will start it again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in this case the type is "Aud" but if the Aud is lazy-loaded then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it starts as type "AC" (Asset Container) and then when loaded becomes "Aud"
file - the filename used
src - the src used - path and file - available on complete event
item - the CreateJS data item used for preload - available on complete event

PROPERTIES (of AbstractSoundInstance)
** full docs here: https://www.createjs.com/docs/soundjs/classes/AbstractSoundInstance.html
paused - set to true to pause and false to unpause
muted - set to true to mute - but sound keeps playing or false to unmute
volume - the volume with 1 being the default
pan - set from -1 (full left) to 1 (full right) with 0 in middle (may not work until on server)
position - set to place in sound in milliseconds (ZIM TIME constant does not affect this)
duration - the length of the sound in milliseconds

EVENTS
dispatches a "ready" or "complete" event when the sound is loaded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if preloaded this is dispatched 20 ms after the Aud is made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: the AbstractSoundInstance below also dispatches a "complete" event when the sound is finished playing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
EVENTS (of AbstractSoundInstance)
** full docs here: https://www.createjs.com/docs/soundjs/classes/AbstractSoundInstance.html
complete - dispatched when the sound has reached the end - after any loops (not before)
loop - dispatched when the sound loops (but not at end of last loop - that is complete)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;currently triggering at the first play too.


************************************
[80160] Vid(file, width, height, volume, loop, align, valign, type, style, group, inherit)

Vid
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Use Vid() to show a video. Use the play() method to start the video when loaded.
The user must interact with the app before play() will work.
There may be a security error when loading video locally for any Canvas app.
Please read https://zimjs.com/tips.html#VIDEO for easy solutions.

Vid will add an HTML 5 video and source tag in behind the scene
and pipe the video into a ZIM Bitmap which is shown in the Vid container.
Vid lets you pause() and play() and get the duration
or get and set the currentTime and volume.

A source property stores the HTML 5 video for more methods, properties and events.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video

Vid also has a keyOut() method to key out a color from the video.

SEE: https://zimjs.com/zim/assets.html

Vid will give a "ready" and a "complete" event when ready to play.

NOTE: Vid is a container with a bitmap inside (see bitmap property).
This means that other objects can be added to the Vid object.
This is like the ZIM Shapes (Rectangle, Circle, etc.) which are containers and can have objects added to them.
If doing this, note that the container has its mouseChildren turned off
so when dragging, for instance, the whole vid moves rather than the bitmap inside the vid.
To interact with objects inside, set vid.mouseChildren = true.
Generally, for clarity, avoid adding objects to Shapes or Vids unless you are used to the mouseChildren setting.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// video is a container that will have a width of 800 and height of 600
// The video will be FIT inside these dimensions and centered by default
// Also see align and valign parameters
// At the start, it will have a type of "AC" once it loads it will be "Vid"
const video = new Vid("video.mp4", 800, 600)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center() // using 800x600
S.on("stagemousedown", () =&gt; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;video.play();
});

EXAMPLE
// video is a container that will have a width of 800 and height of 600
// The video will be stretched to 800 by 600 - possibly changing the aspect ratio
const video = new Vid("video.mp4", 800, 600, FULL)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center() // using 800x600
S.on("stagemousedown", () =&gt; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;video.play();
});

EXAMPLE
// video is a container with no width and height to start
// once the video is loaded the container will take the dimensions of the video
// and the center() will be called again to properly center the container
// just like lazy loading Pic().
const video = new Vid("video.mp4")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center() // will automatically be re-centered after loading
S.on("stagemousedown", () =&gt; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;video.play();
});

EXAMPLE
// make the video cover the stage
const video = new Vid("video.mp4", W, H, FILL)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
S.on("stagemousedown", () =&gt; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;video.play();
});

EXAMPLE
// load a video from the assets/ folder
PATH = "assets/"

// either provide width and height before scaleTo() or use the ready event
const video = new Vid("video.mp4", W, H).center();

video.on("ready", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// video.keyOut("#01b03f", .2);  // optional keyOut a green color
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// do not play the video until we interact with the app
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const pane = new Pane("VIDEO ON CANVAS!").show(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// this (the callback) runs when the pane is closed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;video.play();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
});

// toggle the pause of the video
video.on("mousedown", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// note videoPaused property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// not paused (which is for animation)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;video.pause(!video.videoPaused);
});

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
file - |ZIM VEE| the String file name of the image including file extension for instance, "pic.png"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a global PATH constant that can be set to add a path to the start of the file name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for instance setting PATH = "assets/" would then look for "assets/pic.png".
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a path is provided to Frame() parameter or the loadAssets() then these will automatically set the global PATH constant.
width - (default null) optionally predict the width of the video for placement before being loaded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The width will be ignored once the video is loaded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To change the width of Vid, use siz() or sca() methods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or width, widthOnly, height, heightOnly, scale, scaleX and scaleY properties.
height - (default null) optionally predict the height of the Vid (see width for similar details)
scaling - (defaut FIT) how to scale video into dimensions if provided - otherwise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIT  - scales video to fit inside width and height keeping aspect ratio - also see align and valign
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FILL - scales video to surround width and height keeping aspect ratio - also see align and valign
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FULL - scales video width to width and video height to height possibly stretching aspect ratio
volume - (default 1) the volume of the video - also see the volume property
loop - (default false) set to true to loop the video
align - (default CENTER) for FIT and FILL, the horizontal alignment LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT
valign - (default CENTER) for FIT and FILL, the vertical alignment TOP, CENTER, BOTTOM
type - (default "video/mp4") the mime type or codec of the video
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/codecs_parameter
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
play() - play the video
pause(state) - pause the video if the state is true (default) or play again if state is false
keyOut(color, tolerance, replacement) - remove a certain color in the video and make it see-through - with a color tolerance between 0-1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the default color is "#389b26" which is a medium dark green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the default tolerance is .1 - the higher the tolerance the less sensitive the keying process - so more colors will be removed similar to the provided color
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color and tolerance can be an array of colors and tolerances (or just one tolerance if all are the same)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replacement (default clear) a color to replace the keyed out color with or an optional array to match the colors array if an array is used
clone(exact) - clone the object - if using ZIM VEE values for file, use exact true to copy the picked ZIM VEE option.
dispose() - dispose the video including HTML tags, etc.

ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:
on(), off(), getBounds(), setBounds(), uncache(), updateCache(), dispatchEvent(),
addChild(), removeChild(), addChildAt(), getChildAt(), contains(), removeAllChildren(), etc.

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in this case the type is "Vid" but if no dimensions are provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it starts as type "AC" (Asset Container)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and when the video is ready to play (see "complete" or "ready" event), the type is set to "Vid"
file - the filename used
duration - get the duration of the video in seconds
currentTime - get or set the current time in seconds
volume - get or set the volume of the video
videoPaused - get if the video is paused
bitmap - reference to the the ZIM Bitmap inside the container
source - reference to the HTML video tag with all sorts of methods, properties and events
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use this for the fastSeek() method if currentTime property is too slow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video

ALSO: see ZIM Container for properties such as:
width, height, widthOnly, heightOnly, draggable, level, depth, group
blendMode, hue, saturation, brightness, contrast, etc.

ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container properties, such as:
x, y, rotation, scaleX, scaleY, regX, regY, skewX, skewY,
alpha, cursor, shadow, name, mouseChildren, mouseEnabled, parent, numChildren, etc.

EVENTS
dispatches a "complete" and a "ready" event (use either one) when the image is loaded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if preloaded this is dispatched 20 ms after the Vid is made.
Also see HTML video events: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#events
which has a "complete" event on the source property...
so use myVideo.source.addEventListener("complete", ()=&gt;{});

************************************
[80506] SVG(svg, width, height, bitmap, splitTypes, geometric, showControls, interactive, style, group, inherit)

SVG
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Use SVG() to show an SVG tag or file on the Canvas.
There are two options, the default is as a Bitmap
or choose an SVGContainer with Blob, Squiggle, and transformable shapes.

Before ZIM version ZIM 00, svgToBitmap() or SVGContainer() was used to show SVGs.
These can still be used if desired. The SVG() class just wraps these.

SEE: https://zimjs.com/zim/assets.html

NOTE: ZIM has Squiggle() and Blob() which often can replace the need for SVG() and has many more benefits.
These can be made with ZIM Pizzazz 4 at https://zimjs.com/paths
Or an SVG path can be passed directly to the points parameter of a Blob or Squiggle.
Squiggles and Blobs let the user:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turn the paths editable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animate objects on the path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add Beads to the path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animate the path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shape animate the path to another path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do hitTestPath on the path
We recommend using SVG only when there is already an SVG that image you want to use.

PRELOADING
It is recommended that you preload SVG files using the Frame() assets and path parameters.
After the frame loads, SVG files can also be loaded on demand with F.loadAssets().
Batch loading SVGs is more efficient and the width and height will be available when the Frame() is "ready" or loadAssets() is "complete".

LAZY-LOADING
If SVGs are not preloaded then SVG() will use automatic loading (lazy-loading).
If width and height are provided, all will go smoothly.
If width and height are not provided, ZIM will store various scaling and positioning commands
and re-apply the commands once the images are loaded.
This happens for center(), centerReg(), pos(), scaleTo(), outline() and perhaps others.
This extra work is NOT required if assets are preloaded or a width and height are provided.
Some controls like Tile() and Scroller() must have dimensions and will give a warning in the console.
In the past there has been issues with cloning lazy-loaded objects before they are loaded, but this should work now.

SVG will give a "ready" and a "complete" event when loaded.
These events are triggered 20 ms after making the object if the object is already preloaded.

NOTE: SVG is a container with a bitmap inside (see bitmap property)
or if the bitmap option is not selected there are other shapes inside.
This means that other objects can be added to the SVG object.
This is like the ZIM Shapes (Rectangle, Circle, etc.) which are containers and can have objects added to them.
If doing this, note that the container has its mouseChildren may be turned off
so when dragging, for instance, the whole SVG moves rather than the bitmap inside the SVG.
To interact with objects inside, set pic.mouseChildren = true.
Generally, for clarity, avoid adding objects to Shapes, Pics SVGs unless you are used to the mouseChildren setting.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// lazy-load an SVG
new SVG("file.svg").center().drag();

EXAMPLE
// assuming there is an SVG tag on the page - could be display:none
new SVG(zid("svgTagID")).center().drag();

EXAMPLE
Find the SVG in an assets/ folder
PATH = "assets/"
// Tile a lazy-loaded SVG with dimensions - otherwise Tile would give a console warning
new Tile(new SVG("file.svg", 100, 100), 4, 4)).center();

// but the dimensions might not be right and the tile could look odd once the SVGs are loaded
// would be better to preload - see next example

EXAMPLE
// pre-load and Tile an SVG
new Frame(FIT, 1024, 768, light, grey, ready, "file.svg", "assets/");
function ready() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Tile(new SVG("file.svg"), 4, 4)).center();
}

EXAMPLE
// add an SVGContainer from an SVG string
// this would make a simple Squiggle line with editable points
// see the Docs under SVGContainer for more complex examples and added information
// note the h t t p : should be edited to not have spaces - just avoiding Doc auto linking
const svg = `&lt;svg  width="150" height="200" xmlns="h t t p ://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
&lt;path id="lineAB" d="M 0 0 l 150 200" stroke=red stroke-width="3" fill="none" /&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;`;
new SVG(svg, null, null, false).center();

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
svg - |ZIM VEE| the String file name of the SVG including file extension for instance, "pic.svg"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or an SVG tag either directly as a string or as a reference to an HTML tag - ie. zid("svgID")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a global PATH constant that can be set to add a path to the start of the file name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for instance setting PATH = "assets/" would then look for "assets/pic.svg".
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a path is provided to Frame() parameter or the loadAssets() then these will automatically set the global PATH constant.
width - (default null) optionally predict the width of the SVG
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The width will be ignored and the actual width will be used if the SVG is preloaded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and if lazy-loaded, the width will be replaced with the actual width after the SVG is loaded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the width is only used to tell something like a Tile(), what size to expect before the SVG is loaded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To change the width of an SVG, use siz() or sca() methods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or width, widthOnly, height, heightOnly, scale, scaleX and scaleY properties.
height - (default null) optionally predict the height of the SVG (see width for similar details)
bitmap - (default true) this will show the SVG as a Bitmap (still nicely scalable!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or set to false to use an SVGContainer() which converts the SVG to Blob, Squiggle and ZIM Shapes with transforms.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows for editable paths - but perhaps not all aspects of SVGs are supported such as CSS styles on SVGs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, a single SVG path can be passed to a ZIM Blob() or Squiggle() and SVG() can be avoided.
** these parameters are NOT for the bitmap option but rather for the SVGContainer
splitTypes - (default false) - set to true to split different types of paths into separate objects
geometric - (default true) - set to false to load Rectangle and Circle objects as Blob objects
showControls - (default true) set to false to start with controls not showing
interactive - (default true) set to false to turn off controls, move, toggle, select, edit - leaving just the shapes
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
keyOut(color, tolerance, replacement) - for Bitmap setting - remove a certain color in the SVG and make it see-through - with a color tolerance between 0-1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the default color is "#389b26" which is a medium dark green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the default tolerance is .1 - the higher the tolerance the less sensitive the keying process - so more colors will be removed similar to the provided color
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color and tolerance can be an array of colors and tolerances (or just one tolerance if all are the same)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replacement (default clear) a color to replace the keyed out color with or an optional array to match the colors array if an array is used
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in this case the type is "SVG" but if the SVG is lazy-loaded then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it starts as type "AC" (Asset Container) if no dimensions are provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or "ACWD" (Asset Container With Dimensions) until the SVG is loaded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at which point, the type is set to "SVG"
bitmap - reference the the ZIM Bitmap inside the container.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this exists for both the bitmap setting and the SVGContainer setting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but with the SVGContainer setting, the bitmap is not added to the container
svg - reference to the SVG code
file - the filename used
src - the source with path and filename - available on complete event
item - the CreateJS data item used for preload - available on complete event

ALSO: see ZIM Container for properties such as:
width, height, widthOnly, heightOnly, draggable, level, depth, group

EVENTS
dispatches a "complete" and a "ready" event (use either one) when the SVG is loaded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if preloaded this is dispatched 20 ms after the SVG is made.

************************************
[80827] Fonts - loaded into Frame()

Fonts
For a Label object or components with labels

DESCRIPTION
As of ZIM ZIM 02, custom fonts can be loaded by their file name without the need for a font object {}.
Custom fonts must be preloaded in the Frame() or loadAssets() assets parameter.
Supported fonts are "ttf","otf","woff2","woff","fnt" files and Google fonts.
The font is then available to Label and components with labels.
ZIM wraps the CreateJS PreloadJS library to offer simplified loading.

NOTE: do not use uppercase letters on font name or extension - seems to not load on mobile.

NOTE: system fonts can be used without loading the font.

**************
DO NOT make a new Font() - rather, pass the font information into the Frame assets parameter.
Or load fonts when desired with Frame loadAssets() and wait for a complete event.
In either case, the font will then be available for Labels
**************

EXAMPLE
new Frame({ready, assets:"Reuben.otf", path:"assets/"});
function ready() {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Label("Custom Font", 30, "Reuben").center();&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
}

EXAMPLE
// here is the same but with the font object - used pre ZIM ZIM 02 - this still works
new Frame({ready, assets:{font:"Reuben", src:"Reuben.otf"}, path:"assets/"});
function ready() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Label("Custom Font", 30, "Reuben").center();
}

EXAMPLE
// use a Google font https://fonts.google.com/ and apply it with a STYLE
new Frame(FIT, 1024, 768, red, dark, ready, "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Dancing+Script");
function ready() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STYLE = {font:"Dancing Script"}; // or include + but not necessary.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Label("Custom Google Font").center();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Label("Second Custom Google Font").center().mov(0,100);
}


************************************
[80879] Keys - keyboard methods and events

Keys
"keydown" and "keyup" Frame events

DESCRIPTION
The Frame has a "keydown" and "keyup" events to capture key presses
and a keyboardMessage() method to prompt for keyboard interactivity.

When an app is first loaded it cannot receive keyboard events until it is interacted with.
Interaction must be a mousedown or click - not just an over or move interaction.
Often, we will make an intro Pane() or play Button() for a game, for instance, before playing sounds.
In ZIM 014 we added a keyboardMessage() method to prompt for an interaction so key events are activated.

Also see ZIM Keyboard(), TextEditor(), TextInput() and MotionController() for various keyboard functionality.

EXAMPLE
keyboardMessage(); // will prompt for keyboard control
F.on("keydown", e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(e.key) // a string of the keypress
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(e.keyCode) // the numeric code of the keypress (older but used in lots of examples)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(F.altKey) // true if alt is pressed - also: ctrlKey, metaKey, shiftKey
});
// for controlling a game object with keyboard please see MotionController(obj, "keydown")
// as the MotionController solves a few tricky issues with key control


************************************
[80910] Cursors - custom cursors

Cursors
Frame property

DESCRIPTION
In ZIM 014 we added support for custom cursors as a Frame property
to get or set an object literal with custom cursors that override the CSS cursors or act on their own.
See: https://zimjs.com/014/cursors.html
the format is:
F.cursors = {default:DisplayObject, pointer:DisplayObject, madeUp:DisplayObject, etc.}
NOTE: use the cur() method to specify which cursor is on an object.
drag(), tap(), etc. will already work with the custom cursor system
set F.cursors = null to turn off custom cursors

There is a Frame cursorsExlcude() method to exclude certain objects from the custom cursors.
There is a Frame cursorObj property to indicate the current custom cursor.


EXAMPLE
F.cursors = {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// the default cursor will be an emitter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;default:new Emitter({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj:new Circle({min:3,max:8},white),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;force:1,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gravity:0
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;box:new Rectangle(40,40,clear,white,8,0,true)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.reg(CENTER)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.animate({props:{dashedOffset:-110}, rewind:true, loop:true})
}
const rect = new Rectangle(500,500,red).center().cur("box"); // apply the box cursor


************************************
[80948] Tilt - device motion and orientation events

Tilt
"devicemotion" and "deviceorientation" Frame events

DESCRIPTION
The Frame has a "devicemotion" event to capture device tilt
and a "deviceorientation" to capture device rotation (like a compass)

Also see the SensorAsk() class which will handle asking for permission on iOS devices.

NOTE:
For either event the Frame sensors parameter MUST be set to true

EXAMPLE
// for capturing tilt on device (rotation about an axis)
// also SEE the SensorAsk example below
// also set Frame sensors parameter to true
// and be on a mobile device
const label = new Label().center();
F.on("deviceorientation", e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;label.text = e.rotation.x +","+ e.rotation.y +","+ e.rotation.z;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

EXAMPLE
// on iOS, the sensors must be allowed first - this example works for all devices
const sensorType = "deviceorientation"; // or "devicemotion"
const ask = new SensorAsk(init, sensorType);
function init(yes) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// if the user answers yes to the SensorAsk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const errorPane = new Pane("SENSOR not available",yellow);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (yes) {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// use the sensors &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;label.text = decimals(e.rotation.x) +","+ decimals(e.rotation.y) +","+ decimals(e.rotation.z);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} else { // answered no to SensorAsk dialog&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;errorPane.show();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
}

EXAMPLE
// for shaking motion - ALSO see the SensorAsk example above for iOS
// and replace "deviceorientation" with "devicemotion"
// and replace e.rotation.x, etc. with e.acceleration.x etc.
// also set Frame sensors parameter to true
// and be on a mobile device
const label = new Label().center();
F.on("devicemotion", e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;label.text = e.acceleration.x +","+ e.acceleration.y +","+ e.acceleration.z;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

EVENTS
"devicemotion" - for tilt (also set Frame sensors parameter to true)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fired on moving mobile device - like a tilt or shake - eventObject.acceleration holds x, y and z properties of motion
"deviceorientation" - for rotation (also set Frame sensors parameter to true)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fired as device orientation changes:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eventObject.rotation.x (beta in HTML specs) holds rotation about the x axis between -180 and 180 (tipped forward or backward)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eventObject.rotation.y (gamma in HTML specs) holds rotation about the y axis between -90 and 90 (tipped left or right)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eventObject.rotation.z (alpha in HTML specs) holds rotation about the z axis 0-360 clockwise (relative to orientation when app loads)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note rotation.z is 360-alpha compared to the HTML 5 specs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note also that beta, gamma and alpha from the HTML 5 specs are also provided


************************************
[81019] SensorAsk(callback, sensorType, color, backgroundColor, style, group, inherit)

SensorAsk
zim class - extends a zim.Pane which extends a zim.Container

DESCRIPTION
A circular confirmation widget to ask the user if they want to use the sensors.
This is before the Browser will ask for permission.
The reason is that iOS does not allow sensors until confirmed.
If not in iOS then will just pass through the test.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// on iOS, the sensors must be allowed first
const sensorType = "deviceorientation"; // or "devicemotion"
const ask = new SensorAsk(init, sensorType);
function init(yes) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// if the user answers yes to the SensorAsk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const errorPane = new Pane("SENSOR not available",yellow);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (yes) {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// use the sensors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const label = new Label({text:"test on mobile", align:CENTER}).centerReg();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.on("devicemotion", e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// use the sensors &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;label.text = decimals(e.rotation.x) +","+ decimals(e.rotation.y) +","+ decimals(e.rotation.z);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} else { // answered no to SensorAsk dialog&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;errorPane.show();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
}

PARAMETERS - accepts ZIM DUO regular parameters in order or a configuration object with parameters as properties
callback - the function to callback when sensor is accepted - will receive true for accept or false for no sensor made available
sensorType - (default "deviceorientation") either deviceorientation or devicemotion
color - (default zim.dark) the font and border color of the widget
backgroundColor - (default zim.lighter) the backgroundColor of the widget

METHODS
dispose() - dispose the SensorAsk

ALSO: see all the methods of a zim Pane()
including hide()

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:
on(), off(), getBounds(), setBounds(), cache(), uncache(), updateCache(), dispatchEvent(),
addChild(), removeChild(), addChildAt(), getChildAt(), contains(), removeAllChildren(), etc.

PROPERTIES

************************************
[81165] Colors - orange, green, pink, blue, brown, yellow, purple, red, interstellar, black, darker, licorice, dark, charcoal, grey, gray, granite, tin, pewter, silver, fog, mist, light, moon, lighter, white, faint, clear

Colors - orange, green, pink, blue, brown, yellow, purple, red, interstellar, black, darker, licorice, dark, charcoal, grey, gray, granite, tin, pewter, silver, fog, mist, light, moon, lighter, wh¡te, faint, clear
zim constants (lowercase)

DESCRIPTION
ZIM colors for convenience - such as blue, green, dark, etc.
Traditional HTML colors as strings can also be used such as "blue", "tomato", etc.
Also available are HEX numbers as strings such as "#333" or "#cc0000"
and RGB and RGBA of 0-255 values for red, green, blue with 0 being no color and 255 being full color
then alpha from 0 to 1 as a decimal with 0 being transparent to 1 being opaque.
These are in a string such as "rgb(0,0,255)" or "rgba(0,0,0,.2)" (.2 is alpha)

NOTE: ZIM colors started off as properties of the frame so F.blue
but the frame properties have now been removed as they are stored on the zim namespace or as globals

FAINT AND CLEAR
faint is "rgba(0,0,0,.01)" which is the faintest color that can be interacted with
clear is "rgba(0,0,0,0)" which is invisble but cannot be interacted with
However, clear can be used along with expand(0) to be able to interact with an object
where the expand(0) (or whatever padding is desired) adds a CreateJS hitArea.

DARKEN AND LIGHTEN
ZIM has added darken() and lighten() methods to the JS String prototype to handle easy darkening and lightening of colors
This is very handy in desiging.
https://zimjs.com/docs.html?item=darken
https://zimjs.com/docs.html?item=lighten

COLOR BLENDS
ZIM has toColor() to move one color towards another color
https://zimjs.com/docs.html?item=toColor

ALPHA
ZIM has toAlpha() to set the alpha of colors
https://zimjs.com/docs.html?item=toAlpha

GRADIENTS
ZIM DisplayObjects accept GradientColor(), RadialColor() and BitmapColor() objects - see docs under the CODE module for info.
https://zimjs.com/docs.html?item=GradientColor

// is the same as
new Circle(100, "#50c4b7").center();

// ZIM colors (or HTML colors) can have alpha adjusted as follows:
new Circle(100, blue.toAlpha(.5)).center();

// colors can be darkened or lightened using darken() or lighten()
new Circle(100, blue.darken(.5)).center();

// colors can be blended using toColor()
new Circle(100, blue.toColor(red, .2)).center();

zim constants

DESCRIPTION
ZIM positioning, data and sound constants for convenience if desired.
These are all equal to strings with lowercase values.
So using TOP is the same as using TOP

Positioning: FIT, FILL, FULL, LEFT, RIGHT, CENTER, MIDDLE, START, END TOP, BOTTOM, HORIZONTAL, VERTICAL, BOTH, RADIAL, UP, DOWN, NEXT, PREV, AUTO, DEFAULT, ALL, NONE, AVE
Data: GET, POST, LOCALSTORAGE, SOCKET, TO, FROM, BOTH
Sound: SINE, SQUARE, TRIANGLE, SAW, ZAP

NOTE: there are a set of constants at the start of the CONTROLS module as well

NOTE: for START and END, see DIR constant under CONTROLS module.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
new Tip("hello", RIGHT, MIDDLE).show();
// same as
new Tip("hello", "right", "middle").show();


************************************
[81330] Globals - F, S, W, H, M

Globals - F, S, W, H, M
zim globals

DESCRIPTION
These are not all the global variables in ZIM.
If zns is not set to true, then all classes in ZIM and functions in the CODE module are global.
Also note the Constants in the docs listing above.  And the set of constants in the CONTROLS module.

ADDED ZIM ZIM 01:
F - the ZIM default frame - also there is a zimDefaultFrame and zdf global variable made - but F is easier.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ZIM default frame is the first frame made - or the frame that last has the setDefault() method called
S - the Stage of the default frame - this will be the stage that addTo(), center(), etc. get added to if no container is provided
W - the width of the default frame - this will be updated automatically in FULL mode on window resize.
H - the height of the default frame - this will be updated automatically in FULL mode on window resize.
M - false if not on mobile, otherwise reports the mobile device "iOS", "android", etc. - can also use mobile().

There are many previous examples that declare frame, stage, W and H
this technique can still be used but you are welcome to use the F, S, W, H if desired.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
new Frame({ready});
function ready() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const c = new Circle().pos(W*.2, H*.2);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.on("keydown", e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.sca(rand(.5,3));
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(M); // false if on desktop/laptop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});

[08057] displayBase()

displayBase
zim function

DESCRIPTION
Used internally by ZIM to set common properties on basic DisplayObjects
Container, Shape, Bitmap, Sprite, MovieClip
Also called by zimify() if object does not already have these (hueBatch used for test)
Turns off and on allowDefault if allowDefault is true as object is interacted with
this prevents the page from scrolling on mobile when drag, gesture, transform, etc. are happening
Might have set these on CreateJS DisplayObject

[08303] Stage(canvasID, touch, singleTouch)

Stage
zim class - extends a createjs.Stage which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
An extension of a createjs.Stage that includes read only type, width and height properties, loop and hitTestGrid methods.
When using zim.Frame, there should be no reason to make a zim.Stage.
This was put in place to match the ZIM TypeScript typings for stage width and height.
Also see https://www.createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/Stage.html

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const stage = new Stage("canvasID");

PARAMETERS
canvasID - (default null) string ID for canvas tag
touch - (default false) set to true for touch on mobile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be multitouch unless singleTouch is set to true
singleTouch - (default false) set to true for single touch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will override touch setting and turn touch to true but with single touch

METHODS
loop(call, reverse, step, start, end) - see the ZIM Display Methods loop() for details
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; see the ZIM Display Methods loop() for details
hitTestGrid(width, height, cols, rows, x, y, offsetX, offsetY, spacingX, spacingY, local, type)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see the ZIM Display Methods hitTestGrid() for details
disposeAllChildren() - remove and dispose all children
See the CreateJS Easel Docs for Stage methods, such as:
clear, update, toDataURL
And all the Container methods such as:
on, off, setBounds, getBounds, globalToLocal, etc.

PROPERTIES
frame - if made with ZIM Frame then frame points to the frame that made the stage
type - holds the class name as a String
width - read only width set by ZIM Frame
height - read only height set by ZIM Frame

ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Stage properties, such as:
autoClear, canvas, nextStage, etc.
and all the Container properties, such as:
children, mouseChildren, filters, cacheCanvas, etc.

Note: also makes a partial zdf allowing circle.center() to work
but will be overwritten if an actual Frame is made

EVENTS
See the CreateJS Easel Docs for Stage events, such as:
mouseenter, mouseleave, stagemousedown, stagemousemove, stagemouseup, drawstart, drawend, etc.
and all the Container events such as:
click, dblclick, mousedown, mouseout, mouseover, pressdown (ZIM), pressmove, pressup, removed, rollout, rollover

[08462] StageGL(canvasID, options, touch, singleTouch)

StageGL
zim class - extends a zim.Stage which extends a createjs.Stage

DESCRIPTION
An extension of a zim.Stage for WebGL support
See ZIM Stage and https://www.createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/StageGL.html

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const stage = new StageGL("canvasID", {preserveBuffer:true, antialias:true});

PARAMETERS
canvasID - (default null) string ID for canvas tag
options - (default null) an object literal with the following properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM https://www.createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/StageGL.html
preserveBuffer (default false)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If true, the canvas is NOT auto-cleared by WebGL (the spec discourages setting this to true). This is useful if you want persistent draw effects.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;antialias (default false)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifies whether or not the browser's WebGL implementation should try to perform anti-aliasing. This will also enable linear pixel sampling on power-of-two textures (smoother images).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transparent (default false)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If true, the canvas is transparent. This is very expensive, and should be used with caution.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;premultiply (default false)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alters color handling. If true, this assumes the shader must account for pre-multiplied alpha. This can help avoid visual halo effects with some assets, but may also cause problems with other assets.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;autoPurge (default 1200)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How often the system should automatically dump unused textures with purgeTextures(autoPurge) every autoPurge/2 draws. See purgeTextures for more information.
touch - (default false) set to true for touch on mobile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be multitouch unless singleTouch is set to true
singleTouch - (default false) set to true for single touch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will override touch setting and turn touch to true but with single touch

METHODS
loop(call, reverse, step, start, end) - see the ZIM Display Methods loop() for details
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; see the ZIM Display Methods loop() for details
hitTestGrid(width, height, cols, rows, x, y, offsetX, offsetY, spacingX, spacingY, local, type)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see the ZIM Display Methods hitTestGrid() for details
disposeAllChildren() - remove and dispose all children
See the CreateJS Easel Docs for StageGL methods:
https://www.createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/StageGL.html

PROPERTIES
frame - if made with ZIM Frame then frame points to the frame that made the stage
type - holds the class name as a String
width - read only width set by ZIM Frame
height - read only height set by ZIM Frame

See the CreateJS Easel Docs for Stage properties:
https://www.createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/StageGL.html

Note: also makes a partial zdf allowing circle.center() to work
but will be overwritten if an actual Frame is made

EVENTS

************************************
[08625] Container(a, b, c, d, style, group, inherit)

Container
zim class - extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
A Container object is used to hold other display objects or other containers.
You can then move, rotate, scale and skew the container and all objects inside will transform accordingly.
You can apply an event on a container and use the target property of the event object
to access the object in the container that caused the event
or use the currentTarget property of the event object to access the container itself.
Containers do not have bounds unless some items in the container have bounds -
at which point the bounds are the combination of the bounds of the objects with bounds.
You can manually set the bounds with setBounds(x,y,w,h) - read the CreateJS docs.
Or pass in width and height, or boundsX, boundsY, width, height to have Container set bounds.
Manually set bounds will not update automatically unless you setBounds(null).

NOTE: All the ZIM shapes and components extend the Container.
This means all shapes and components inherit the methods and properties below
and indeed, the Container inherits all the createjs.Container methods and properties.
See the CreateJS documentation for x, y, alpha, rotation, on(), addChild(), etc.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const container = new Container().loc(100,100);

// demonstration of adding drag() to a Container
const rect = new Rectangle(100, 100, blue)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.addTo(container); // add rectangle to container
const circle = new Circle(40, red)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center(container) // add the circle to the container and center
container.drag(); // will drag either the rectangle or the circle
container.drag({all:true}); // will drag both the rectangle and the circle

// below will reduce the alpha of the object in the container that was clicked (target)
container.on("click", e =&gt; {e.target.alpha = .5; S.update();})
// below will reduce the alpha of all the objects in the container (currentTarget)
container.on("click", e =&gt; {e.currentTarget.alpha = .5; S.update();})

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
** Container has a, b, c, d parameters to set x, y, width and height
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two settings that are more common than providing all four parameters:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. provide no parameters to make a Container with bounds that grow with content.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. provide a and b only to make a Container with a width and height (and bounds with x and y of 0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is what happens when you provide 1, 2 or all of the a,b,c,d parameters:
a - (default null) - width and height will be equal to parameter a (x and y will be 0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or provide a ZIM Boundary() object or createjs Rectangle() object with x, y, width and height properties
a, b - (default null) - the width and height (x and y will be 0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is the normal way to make a container with a starting width and height
a, b, c, d - (default null) - the x, y, width and height of the bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if parameter a is not set, then the Container will take bounds that grow with its content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bounds of the Container can be set at any time with setBounds(a, b, c, d)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the bounds are set, then the Container bounds will not change as content is added
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bounds can be removed with setBounds(null) and the Container will get auto bounds
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
* This class has all the DISPLAY METHODS introduced in ZIM 4TH
* the methods are available to all ZIM Display objects that extend a ZIM Container
* such as ZIM Rectangle, Circle, Triangle, BLob
* as well as all components like: Label, Button, Slider, Dial, Tab, Pane, etc.
* as well as the ZIM display wrappers: Container, Shape, Sprite, MovieClip and Bitmap
cache(width||x, height||y, null||width, null||height, scale, options, margin, rtl, willReadFrequently) - overrides CreateJS cache() and returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** Supports ZIM DUO
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not provide the first four parameters, then the cache dimensions will be set to the bounds of the object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width||x - (default getBounds().x) the width of the chache - or the x if first four parameters are provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height||y - (default getBounds().y) the height of the chache - or the y if first four parameters are provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width - (default getBounds().width) the width of the chache - or null if first two parameters are provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height - (default getBounds().height) the height of the chache - or null if first two parameters are provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scale - (default 1) set to 2 to cache with twice the fidelity if later scaling up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;options - (default null) additional parameters for cache logic - see CreateJS somewhere for details
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;margin - (default 0) add or subtract a margin from the bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. margin:10 will make the cache size 10 pixels more on all sides
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can be handy when caching objects with borders - that go half outside the natural bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rtl - (default null) set to true to use right to left
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;willReadFrequently - (default null) set to true if planning on using operations with getImageData() or toDataURL()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you get a warning in the console about willReadFrequently then set this to true
updateCache() - updates the cache if cache() is set
uncache() - uncaches and returns object for chaining
setBounds(width||x||Boundary, height||y, null||width, null||height) - overrides CreateJS setBounds() and returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not provide any parameters, then the bounds will be reset to the calculated bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width||x||Boundary - (default null) the width of the bounds - or the x if four parameters are provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or a ZIM Boundary Object {x,y,width,height} - same as CreateJS Rectangle - thanks Joseph Diefenbach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height||y - (default width) the height of the bounds - or the y if four parameters are provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width - (default null) the width of the bounds - or null if only the first two parameters are provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height - (default null) the height of the bounds - or null if only the first two parameters are provided
getBounds(targetSpace) - overrides CreateJS getBounds() and returns a rectangle with x, y, width height of bounds (not including outside of border)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass in a Container (including Stage) to map rectangle to that coordinate space
childrenToBitmap() - turns content to a Bitmap and adds bitmap to container - removing all other children
specialColor(colorCommand, colorObject) - used internally by ZIM Shapes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to set GradientColor, RadialColor and BitmapColor on a fill or stroke color command
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone(exact) - clones the container, its properties and all its children
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exact (default false) ZIM VEE (Pick) values are active in clones unless exact is set to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, if a Container holds a new Circle(20,[blue,green])
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then its clone might be blue or green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If exact is set to true then the clone will be whatever color was picked for the original circle
disposeAllChildren() - removes and disposes all children but leaves the container (see also CreateJS removeAllChildren() which does not dispose them)
dispose(disposing) - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if calling dispose() on the super class from a custom class then pass in true to indicate already started dispose (otherwise infinite loops)

ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:
on(), off(), uncache(), updateCache(), dispatchEvent(),
addChild(), removeChild(), addChildAt(), getChildAt(), contains(), removeAllChildren(), etc.

PROPERTIES
** common to all DisplayObjects that extend a Container such as ZIM Shapes and Components
type - holds the class name as a String
group - used when the object is made to add STYLE with the group selector (like a CSS class)
** bounds must be set first (or width and height parameters set) for these to work
** setting these adjusts scale not bounds and getting these uses the bounds dimension times the scale
width - gets or sets the width. Setting the width will scale the height to keep proportion (see widthOnly below)
height - gets or sets the height. Setting the height will scale the width to keep proportion (see heightOnly below)
widthOnly - gets or sets the width.  This sets only the width and may change the aspect ratio of the object
heightOnly - gets or sets the height.  This sets only the height and may change the aspect ratio of the object
draggable - set to true for a default drag() and false for a noDrag()
level - gets or sets the level of the object in its parent container (or the stage) - a property for parent.getChildIndex() and parent.setChildIndex()
depth - for ZIM VR - the depth used to shift left and right channel and for parallax in VR - also see dep() ZIM Display method
blendMode - how the object blends with what is underneath - such as "difference", "multiply", etc. same as CreateJS compositeOperation
effects - an object that holds effects added such as blur, glow, shadow, color, multi and alpha - see effect() under ZIM Methods
** the following are convenience Effects that run a ZIM MultiEffect()
** these can use a lot of processing when animating - see Docs for effects()
** batch versions are available too as hueBatch, etc. these will not update the effect until updateEffects() is called on the object
hue - the tint of an object between -180 and 180 with 0 being no change
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also see the keyOut() method of Bitmap(), Pic() and SVG() that has a replacement color parameter
saturation - the amount of color of an object between -100 and 100 with 0 being no change
brightness - the lightness or darkness of an object between -255 and 255 with 0 being no change
contrast - the crispness of an object between -100 and 100 with 0 being no change

ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container properties, such as:
x, y, rotation, scale, scaleX, scaleY, regX, regY, skewX, skewY,
alpha, cursor, shadow, name, mouseChildren, mouseEnabled, parent, numChildren, etc.

EVENTS
See the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container events such as:
added, click, dblclick, mousedown, mouseout, mouseover, pressdown (ZIM), pressmove, pressup, removed, rollout, rollover

************************************
[09039] Shape(a, b, c, d, graphics, optimize, style, group, inherit)

Shape
zim class - extends a createjs.Shape

DESCRIPTION
ZIM Shape lets you draw dynamic shapes beyond the ZIM provided shapes.
You make a new shape object and then draw in its graphics property
using similar commands to the HTML Canvas commands (and Flash Bitmap drawing).
See the CreateJS Easel Shapes and Graphics docs:
http://www.createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/Graphics.html

ALSO SEE: https://zimjs.com/docs.html?item=Generator for dynamically drawing into shapes like Processing (P5js)
ALSO SEE: https://zimjs.com/docs.html?item=Squiggle,Blob for odd shapes and user adjustable shapes
ALSO SEE: https://zimjs.com/docs.html?item=Pen for dynamic drawing of lines
ALSO SEE: https://zimjs.com/docs.html?item=Connectors for dynamic connections
// these mean we rarely use Shape directly but all of above were made in ZIM with Shape

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

NOTE: as of ZIM 10.6.0 the tiny API is available right on the Shape (no need for graphics)

EXAMPLE
// NEWER CODE
// Uses the tiny API (see options down below) right on the ZIM Shape
// for example: f() is fill() and dr() is drawRect()
// s() is beginStroke(), ss() is setStrokeStyle(), mt() is moveTo(), lt() is lineTo()

// draw a red rectangle into a shape
new Shape().f(red).dr(0,0,200,100).addTo();
// but it would be easier to use
// new Rectangle(200, 100, red).addTo();

// we can draw lines, etc. (but also see the ZIM Line object)
new Shape().s(blue).ss(5).mt(200,200).lt(300,300).addTo();

// note - we can draw as much as we want in the same shape

EXAMPLE
// OLDER CODE
// The first example uses a tiny API (see options below)
// The traditional full commands are available on the graphics object:
const shape = new Shape().addTo();
shape.graphics.beginFill(red).drawRect(0,0,200,100);

// or often we stored the graphics object in a variable g
const g = shape.graphics;
g.beginStroke(blue).moveTo(200,200).lineTo(300,300);

EXAMPLE
// to change a color or stroke after it has been made use command:
const shape = new Shape().addTo();
const strokeColor = shape.s(red).command;
shape.dr(50,50,100,100);
S.update();
timeout(1, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strokeColor.style = blue;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});
// This seems a little complex which is why ZIM provides many basic shapes
// Rectangle, Circle, Triangle, Squiggle, Blob, Poly, Line, Flare
// that can be adjusted dynamically with properties

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
** Shape supports three different sets of parameters as follows:
a - (default null) - width and height equal to parameter a (x and y will be 0)
a, b - (default null) - the width and height (x and y will be 0)
a, b, c, d - (default null) - the x, y, width and height of the bounds
graphics - (default null) a CreateJS Graphics instance (see CreateJS docs)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or just use the graphics property of the shape object (like usual)
optimize - (default false) set to true to not store graphics methods directly on Shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this means the shapes graphics property will need to be used to access f(), s(), ss(), etc.
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
The following shortcuts to CreateJS graphics methods are provided (as long as optimize is false)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height - (default null) the height of the bounds - or null if only the first two parameters are provided
getBounds(targetSpace) - overrides CreateJS getBounds() and returns a rectangle with x, y, width height of bounds (not including outside of border)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass in a Container (including Stage) to map rectangle to that coordinate space
hasProp(property) - returns true if String property exists on object else returns false
clone(recursive) - makes a copy of the shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recursive defaults to true so copy will have own copy of graphics
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set recursive to false to have clone share graphic property
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), placeReg(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:
on(), off(), getBounds(), setBounds(), uncache(), updateCache(), dispatchEvent(),
addChild(), removeChild(), addChildAt(), getChildAt(), contains(), removeAllChildren(), etc.

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
command - save a previously chained operation as a command
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then can use the command to change the operation later (see example above)
group - used when the object is made to add STYLE with the group selector (like a CSS class)
** bounds must be set first (or width and height parameters set) for these to work
** setting these adjusts scale not bounds and getting these uses the bounds dimension times the scale
width - gets or sets the width. Setting the width will scale the height to keep proportion (see widthOnly below)

blendMode - how the object blends with what is underneath - such as "difference", "multiply", etc. same as CreateJS compositeOperation
effects - an object that holds effects added such as blur, glow, shadow, color, multi and alpha - see effect() under ZIM Methods
** the following are convenience Effects that run a ZIM MultiEffect()
** these can use a lot of processing when animating - see Docs for effects()

[09388] Bitmap(image, width, height, left, top, scale, style, group, inherit)

Bitmap
zim class - extends a createjs.Bitmap

DESCRIPTION
Makes a Bitmap object from an image source (image, video or canvas).
It is best to use the assets and path parameters of ZIM Frame or the loadAssets() method of Frame
to preload the image and then use the asset() method to access the Bitmap.
See the ZIM Frame class and asset example on the ZIM Frame page of templates.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
new Frame({ready, assets:"logo.jpg"});
function ready() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const logo = new Pic("logo.jpg").center(); // logo is a Pic with a bitmap property that is a Bitmap&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const logo2 = new Pic("logo.jpg").loc(100,100);
}

EXAMPLE
// turn a container of circles into a Bitmap
const circles = new Container(W, H).addTo();
loop(400, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Circle(rand(200), [pink,green,blue,yellow,purple], dark).center(circles);
});
const pic = new Bitmap(circles).center().drag();
circles.dispose();

// previous to ZIM 10.8.0 we needed to use the cacheCanvas:
var pic = new Bitmap(circles.cache().cacheCanvas).center().drag();

EXAMPLE
// fill a Bitmap with noise:
const noise = new Noise();
// empty Bitmap size 200, 200
const bmp = new Bitmap(null,200,200).center();
// we fill the bitmap starting from top left going across in the inner loop,
// then down, then across, etc. until we get to bottom right.
const f = 50; // used to make noise bigger or smaller - see the blob comment below
for (let y = 0; y &lt; bmp.height; y++) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (let x = 0; x &lt; bmp.width; x++) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// the noise methods return a number from -1 to 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// by adding 1 we get a number between 0 and 2 then divide by 2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// and we multiply this by 255 to get a number between 0 and 255
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let value = (noise.simplex2D(x, y)+1)/2 * 255;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// or get blobs by smoothing and adjusting frequency:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// var value = smoothStep((noise.simplex2D(x/f, y/f)+1)/2, .3,.35) * 255;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// imageData is four values per pixel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// the red, green, blue and alpha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// in one big long array - each value will be constrained to between 0 and 255
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// this i value will increase by 4 each time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// then we write the same value for red, green, blue to get a shade of grey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let i = (x + y * bmp.width) * 4;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bmp.imageData.data[i] = value; // red (0-255)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bmp.imageData.data[i + 1] = value; // green (0-255)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bmp.imageData.data[i + 2] = value; // blue (0-255)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bmp.imageData.data[i + 3] = 255; // alpha (0-255)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}
bmp.drawImageData();

EXAMPLE
// applying filters
new Pic("statue.jpg").effect(new BlurEffect()).center();

EXAMPLE
// getting the color at point(100, 100) on the Bitmap
const bitmap = new Pic("statue.jpg").cache();
const ctx = bitmap.cacheCanvas.getContext('2d');
const data = ctx.getImageData(100, 100, 1, 1).data;
const color = "rgba("+data.join(", ")+")";

EXAMPLE
// a Base64 image - with a long list of characters:
const image = "data:image/png;base64,longlistofcharacters";
const logo;
Bitmap.fromData(image, bitmap=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;logo = bitmap.center();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

EXAMPLE
const thumbs = [];
const cols = 5;
const rows = 5;

const image = asset("yourimage.jpg");
const w = image.width/cols;
const h = image.height/cols;
loop(rows, r=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loop(cols, c=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// make Bitmap show a different part of the main image each time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// note: width, height, left, top
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// NOT x, y, width, height like Container
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// left and top specifiy where in an image
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// to start the picture at 0,0 in the Bitmap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thumbs.push(new Bitmap(image, w, h, c*w, r*h));
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
});
const tile = new Tile(thumbs, cols, rows, 0, 0, true).center();

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
image - an HTML image URL (may not load right away - see Frame loadAssets)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or as of 10.8.0 a DisplayObject - this will be turned into a cacheCanvas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then the DisplayObject turned back to its previous cached setting
width - (default image width or 100) the width of the resulting Bitmap - will potentially crop an image
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see also height, left and top parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which allow part of an image to be drawn into the Bitmap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and is handy rather than masking to cut up an image into squares for instance
height - (default image height or 100) the height of the resulting Bitmap
left - (default 0) where on the source image to start the left of the image
top - (default 0) where on the source image to start the top of the image
scale - if making a Bitmap from a DisplayObject, this will scale the object before it is cached for better resolution
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the resulting bitmap will be the scaled size
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
keyOut(color, tolerance, replacement) - remove color from Bitmap and a tolerance between 0-1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the default color is "#389b26" which is a medium dark green
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the default tolerance is .1 - the higher the tolerance the less sensitive the keying process - so more colors will be removed similar to the provided color
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color and tolerance can be an array of colors and tolerances (or just one tolerance if all are the same)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replacement (default clear) a color to replace the keyed out color with or an optional array to match the colors array if an array is used
fromData(data, callback) - STATIC method so use the Bitmap class directly: Bitmap.fromData()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The callback will receive a reference to the Bitmap after 50ms or 100ms.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no event for making a Bitmap from base64 for instance - so this will have to do.
drawImageData(x, y, sourceX, sourceY, sourceWidth, sourceHeight) - draws the Bitmap's imageData data to the Bitmap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: This is only used when dynamically drawing a Bitmap with data - not for your normal picture
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the imageData property which should be set before using the drawImageData() method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZIM calls a putImageData method for the HTML Canvas and then transfers this to the Bitmap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See also https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/putImageData - but let ZIM do the work...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually just leave the parameters blank
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x - (default 0) where to start putting the drawing in the x
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y - (default 0) where to start putting the drawing in the y
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sourceX - (default 0) where in the imageData to start using the data in the x
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sourceY - (default 0) where in the imageData to start using the data in the y
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sourceWidth - (default the width of the imageData) how much width of the data to use
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sourceHeight - (default the height of the imageData) how much height of the data to use
setBounds(width||x||Boundary, height||y, null||width, null||height) - overrides CreateJS setBounds() and returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not provide any parameters, then the bounds will be reset to the calculated bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width||x||Boundary - (default null) the width of the bounds - or the x if four parameters are provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or a ZIM Boundary Object {x,y,width,height} - same as CreateJS Rectangle - thanks Joseph Diefenbach
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height||y - (default width) the height of the bounds - or the y if four parameters are provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width - (default null) the width of the bounds - or null if only the first two parameters are provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height - (default null) the height of the bounds - or null if only the first two parameters are provided
getBounds(targetSpace) - overrides CreateJS getBounds() and returns a rectangle with x, y, width height of bounds (not including outside of border)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass in a Container (including Stage) to map rectangle to that coordinate space
cache(width||x, height||y, null||width, null||height, scale, options, rtl, willReadFrequently) - overrides CreateJS cache() and returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** Supports ZIM DUO
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** Usually you do not want to cache a Bitmap as it is already a Bitmap ;-)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** But for applying a filter or using a cacheCanvas to get a context, etc. then you might.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not provide the first four parameters, then the cache dimensions will be set to the bounds of the object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width||x - (default getBounds().x) the width of the chache - or the x if first four parameters are provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height||y - (default getBounds().y) the height of the chache - or the y if first four parameters are provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width - (default getBounds().width) the width of the chache - or null if first two parameters are provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height - (default getBounds().height) the height of the chache - or null if first two parameters are provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scale - (default 1) set to 2 to cache with twice the fidelity if later scaling up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;options - (default null) additional parameters for cache logic - see CreateJS somewhere for details
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rtl - (default null) set to true to use Right to Left.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;willReadFrequently - (default null) set to true if planning on using operations with getImageData() or toDataURL()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you get a warning in the console about willReadFrequently then set this to true
getColorAt(x,y,array) - returns the rgba() value at the x and y location - passes array of [r,g,b,a] if array parameter is true
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone() - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied - also copies file and src properties
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if this is a cloned bitmap then the original asset("image.png") will still exist unless it is disposed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Bitmap methods, such as:
on(), off(), dispatchEvent(), etc.

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
file - if loaded as an asset this is the file name
imageData - data for the pixels stored in a data property of an ImageData object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: This is only used when dynamically drawing a Bitmap with data - not for your normal picture
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data property is an one dimensional Array with consecutive red, green, blue, alpha values (0-255) for each pixels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. 0,0,0,255,255,255,255,255 is a black pixel with 1 alpha and a white pixel with 1 alpha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You set this before calling the Bitmap drawImageData() method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See also https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageData - but let ZIM do the work
group - used when the object is made to add STYLE with the group selector (like a CSS class)
** bounds must be set first (or width and height parameters set) for these to work
** setting these adjusts scale not bounds and getting these uses the bounds dimension times the scale
width - gets or sets the width. Setting the width will scale the height to keep proportion (see widthOnly below)
height - gets or sets the height. Setting the height will scale the width to keep proportion (see heightOnly below)
widthOnly - gets or sets the width.  This sets only the width and may change the aspect ratio of the object
heightOnly - gets or sets the height.  This sets only the height and may change the aspect ratio of the object
draggable - set to true for a default drag() and false for a noDrag()
level - gets or sets the level of the object in its parent container (or the stage) - a property for parent.getChildIndex() and parent.setChildIndex()
depth - for ZIM VR - the depth used to shift left and right channel and for parallax in VR - also see dep() ZIM Display method
blendMode - how the object blends with what is underneath - such as "difference", "multiply", etc. same as CreateJS compositeOperation
effects - an object that holds effects added such as blur, glow, shadow, color, multi and alpha - see effect() under ZIM Methods
** the following are convenience Effects that run a ZIM MultiEffect()
** these can use a lot of processing when animating - see Docs for effects()
** batch versions are available too as hueBatch, etc. these will not update the effect until updateEffects() is called on the object
hue - the tint of an object between -180 and 180 with 0 being no change
saturation - the amount of color of an object between -100 and 100 with 0 being no change
brightness - the lightness or darkness of an object between -255 and 255 with 0 being no change
contrast - the crispness of an object between -100 and 100 with 0 being no change

ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Bitmap properties, such as:
x, y, rotation, scaleX, scaleY, regX, regY, skewX, skewY,
alpha, cursor, shadow, mouseEnabled, etc.

[09895] Sprite(image, cols, rows, count, offsetX, offsetY, spacingX, spacingY, width, height, animations, json, id, globalControl, spriteSheet, label, frame, style, group, inherit)

Sprite
zim class - extends a createjs.Sprite

DESCRIPTION
A Sprite plays an animation of a spritesheet
which is a set of images layed out in one file.
You play the Sprite with the run() method.
This animates the Sprite over a given time
with various features like playing a labelled animation,
playing animation series, wait, loop, rewind and call functions.
This actually runs a ZIM animation and animates the frames.

SEE:
https://zimjs.com/interactiveanimation/
https://zimjs.com/spritesheet/
https://zimjs.com/spritesheet/skateboard.html
https://codepen.io/danzen/pen/yEKbbR
https://codepen.io/danzen/pen/VdXzLV
https://zimjs.com/zide/
https://zimjs.com/explore/sidescroller.html (with keyboard)
https://zimjs.com/sprite/ (with Free TexturePacker)

NOTE: A ZIM Sprite handles both an evenly tiled spritesheet - use cols and rows
and an un-evenly tiled spritesheet - use the json parameter.
The json can come from TexturePacker for instance exported for EaselJS/CreateJS
CreateJS Easel Sprite and SpriteSheet docs:
http://www.createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/Sprite.html
http://www.createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/SpriteSheet.html
You can optionally pass in an existing createjs.SpriteSheet as a parameter.
When you do so, all other parameters are ignored.
** JSON hash and JSON array formats are now supported (Phaser formats)
** See https://www.codeandweb.com/free-sprite-sheet-packer

NOTE: You can use CreateJS gotoAndPlay(), play(), etc.
but we found the framerate could not be kept
with other animations or Ticker events running.
So we recommend using the ZIM Sprite run() method.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// inside Frame template
// boom.png is a sprite sheet found online
// It has 8 columns and 6 rows that we can visually count
// We can enter a total parameter if it does not end evenly in the grid
// A graphics editor (like Photoshop) could be used to see
// if there is an offset or spacing, etc. and enter those as parameters
// In this case, we do not need to do any of this - just enter the cols and rows

F.on("complete", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const spriteImage = new Pic("boom.png");

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const animation = new Sprite({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;image:spriteImage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cols:8,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rows:6,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animations:{mid:[10,20], end:[30,40]} // optional animations with labels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// see CreateJS SpriteSheet docs for the various animation format as there are a few different ones!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animation.center();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animation.run(2); // plays the frames of the Sprite over 2 seconds (master time)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// OR use the label to play the frames listed in animations parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animation.run(1, "mid");

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// OR run a series of animations
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// by passing an array of label objects to the label parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// these each have a time so the master time is ignored
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// they can also have any of the run() parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// if you provide an array of labels, you cannot rewind the overall animation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animation.run(null, [
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{label:"mid", time:1},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{label:"end", time:.5, loop:true, loopCount:5, call:function(){zog("loops done");}},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{startFrame:10, endFrame:20, time:1}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]);

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// OR can call a function when done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animation.run(1, "mid", function(){
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.removeChild(animation);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// OR can loop the animation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animation.run({time:2, loop:true}); // see run() parameters for more
});

EXAMPLE
// using Sprite as a texture atlas - or spritesheet of different images
// see: https://zimjs.com/explore/fruit.html
// load in assets and path
new Frame({ready, assets:["fruit.png", "fruit.json"], path:"assets/"});
function ready() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Sprite({json:"fruit.json", label:"apple"}).center();
}

EXAMPLE
// Here is an example with CreateJS SpriteSheet data
// robot.png is a sprite sheet made by ZOE based on a Flash swf
// you can also make your own with Photoshop or Texture Packer

F.loadAssets("robot.png");
F.on("complete", ()=&gt;{

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// using ZOE to export swf animation to spritesheet data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// spritesheet data uses the image name, not the Bitmap itself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const image = new Pic("robot.png").image;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const spriteData = {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"framerate":24,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"images":[image],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"frames":[[0, 0, 256, 256, 0, -54, -10], many more - etc.],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"animations":{}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;};
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const animation = new Sprite({json:spriteData});
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animation.center();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animation.run(2); // note, duration alternative to framerate
});

OR
// load in data from external JSON
F.loadAssets(["robot.json", "robot.png"]);
// ... same as before
const animation = new Sprite({json:"robot.json"});
// ... same as before

// see CreateJS SpriteSheet docs for the format of the JSON file
// including various animation formats

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
image - the ZIM Pic() ir ZIM Bitmap() for the spritesheet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or use a string filename to a preloaded image file (in Frame or loadAssets())
cols - (default 1) - the columns in the spritesheet
rows - (default 1) the rows in the spritesheet
count - (default cols*rows) how many total frames in the spritesheet
offsetX - (default 0) the pixels from the left edge to the frames
offsetY - (default 0) the pixels from the top edge to the frames
spacingX - (default 0) the horizontal spacing between the frames
spacingY - (default 0) the vertical spacing between the frames
width - (default image width) the width including offset and spacing for frames
height - (default image height) the height including offset and spacing for frames
animations - (default null) an object literal of labels holding frames to play
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{label:3, another:[4,10]}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;run(1, "label") would play frame 3 for a second
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;run(1, "another") would play frames 4 to 10 for a second
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{unordered:{frames:[1,2,3,22,23,24,"anotherLabel",5,6], next:prevLabel}}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also ways to set speeds - but would recommend dividing into simple labels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and using the label series technique available with the run() method
json - (default null) a JSON string for a CreateJS SpriteSheet
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or use a string filename to a preloaded JSON file (in Frame or loadAssets())
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you pass in a json parameter, all other parameters are ignored
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: remember that JSON needs quotes around the animation properties above:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{"label":3, "another":[4,10]}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JSON hash and JSON array formats from TexturePacker are supported as well as the createjs/easeljs format
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See https://www.codeandweb.com/free-sprite-sheet-packer for instance
id - (default randomly assigned) an id you can use in other animations - available as sprite.id
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use this id in other animations for pauseRun and stopRun to act on these as well
globalControl - (default true) pauseRun and stopRun will control other animations with same id
spriteSheet - (default null) pass in a CreateJS SpriteSheet to build a Sprite from that
label - (default null) pass in a label to stop on initially - to play from a label use the run({label:val}) method
frame - (default zimDefaultFrame) specify a Frame other than the default frame
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
run(time, label, call, params, wait, waitedCall, waitedParams, loop, loopCount, loopWait, loopCall, loopParams, loopWaitCall, loopWaitParams, loopPick, rewind, rewindWait, rewindCall, rewindParams, rewindWaitCall, rewindWaitParams, rewindTime, rewindEase, startFrame, endFrame, tweek, id, globalControl)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The run() method animates the Sprite over an amount of time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would recommend this method over the CreateJS play() and gotoAndPlay()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;methods because the framerate for these get overwritten by other S.update() calls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With run() you get other nice ZIM animate features as well as follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returns the object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can be paused with pauseAnimate(true) or unpaused with pauseAnimate(false)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can be stopped with stopAnimate() on the Sprite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time (default 1) - the time in seconds to run the animations (the master time)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;label (default null) - a label specified in the Sprite animations parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if this is an array holding label objects for example:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[{label:"run", time:1}, {label:"stand", time:2}]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then the sprite will play the series with the times given and ignore the master time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: if any of the series has a loop and loops forever (a loopCount of 0 or no loopCount)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then this will be the last of the series to run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rewind is not available on the outside series but is available on an inside series
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call - (default null) the function to call when the animation is done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;params - (default target) a single parameter for the call function (eg. use object literal or array)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wait - (default 0) seconds to wait before doing animation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waitedCall - (default null) call the function after a wait time if there is one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waitedParams - (default null) parameters to pass to the waitedCall function
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loop - (default false) set to true to loop animation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loopCount - (default 0) if loop is true how many times it will loop (0 is forever)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loopWait - (default 0) seconds to wait before looping (post animation wait)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loopCall - (default null) calls function after loop and loopWait (not including last loop)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loopParams - (default target) parameters to send loopCall function
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loopWaitCall - (default null) calls function after at the start of loopWait
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loopWaitParams - (default target) parameters to send loopWaitCall function
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rewind - (default false) set to true to rewind (reverse) animation (doubles animation time) (not available on label series)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rewindWait (default 0) seconds to wait in the middle of the rewind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rewindCall (default null) calls function at middle of rewind after rewindWait
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rewindParams - (default target) parameters to send rewindCall function
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rewindWaitCall (default null) calls function at middle of rewind before rewindWait
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rewindWaitParams - (default target) parameters to send rewindCall function
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rewindTime - (default time) set to a time in seconds to adjust the time to rewind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rewindEase - (default null) see ease parameter for options for rewind ease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note - this goes backwards - so "bounceOut" would happen at the end of the rewind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;startFrame - (default null - or 0) the frame to start on - will be overridden by a label with frames
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endFrame - (default null - or totalFrames) the frame to end on - will be overridden by a label with frames

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;id - (default randomly assigned) an id you can use in other animations - available as sprite.id
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use this id in other animations for pauseRun and stopRun to act on these as well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;globalControl - (default true) pauseRun and stopRun will control other animations with same id
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pauseOnBlur - (default true) pause the sprite when the window is not seen or set to false to keep playing the sprite
pauseRun(state) - pause or unpause the animation (including an animation series)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;state - (default true) when true the animation is paused - set to false to unpause
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns object for chaining
stopRun() - stop the sprite from animating
setBounds(width||x||Boundary, height||y, null||width, null||height) - overrides CreateJS setBounds() and returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not provide any parameters, then the bounds will be reset to the calculated bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width||x||Boundary - (default null) the width of the bounds - or the x if four parameters are provided

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass in a Container (including Stage) to map rectangle to that coordinate space
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone() - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Sprite methods, such as:
play(), gotoAndPlay(), gotoAndStop(), stop(), advance(),
on(), off(), dispatchEvent(), etc.

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
id - an id that you can use in other animations to also be controlled by pauseRun() and stopRun()
frame - get and set the current frame of the Sprite
normalizedFrame - if animations have CreateJS speeds applied, zim handles these by making extra frames
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for example, if a speed is given of .5 then two frames are made (min resulution is .1)
normalizedFrames - an array of total frames after being normalized - really for internal usage
totalFrames - get the total frames of the Sprite - read only
animations - the animations data with labels of frames to animate
running - is the sprite animation being run (includes both paused and unpaused) - read only
runPaused - is the sprite animation paused (also returns paused if not running) - read only
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: this only syncs to pauseRun() and stopRun() not pauseAnimate() and stopAnimate()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: CreateJS has paused, etc. but use that only if running the CreateJS methods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such as gotoAndPlay(), gotoAndStop(), play(), stop()
draggable - set to true for a default drag() and false for a noDrag()
group - used when the object is made to add STYLE with the group selector (like a CSS class)
** bounds must be set first (or width and height parameters set) for these to work
** setting these adjusts scale not bounds and getting these uses the bounds dimension times the scale
width - gets or sets the width. Setting the width will scale the height to keep proportion (see widthOnly below)
height - gets or sets the height. Setting the height will scale the width to keep proportion (see heightOnly below)
widthOnly - gets or sets the width.  This sets only the width and may change the aspect ratio of the object
heightOnly - gets or sets the height.  This sets only the height and may change the aspect ratio of the object
draggable - set to true for a default drag() and false for a noDrag()
level - gets or sets the level of the object in its parent container (or the stage) - a property for parent.getChildIndex() and parent.setChildIndex()
depth - for ZIM VR - the depth used to shift left and right channel and for parallax in VR - also see dep() ZIM Display method
blendMode - how the object blends with what is underneath - such as "difference", "multiply", etc. same as CreateJS compositeOperation
effects - an object that holds effects added such as blur, glow, shadow, color, multi and alpha - see effect() under ZIM Methods
** the following are convenience Effects that run a ZIM MultiEffect()
** these can use a lot of processing when animating - see Docs for effects()
** batch versions are available too as hueBatch, etc. these will not update the effect until updateEffects() is called on the object
hue - the tint of an object between -180 and 180 with 0 being no change
saturation - the amount of color of an object between -100 and 100 with 0 being no change
brightness - the lightness or darkness of an object between -255 and 255 with 0 being no change
contrast - the crispness of an object between -100 and 100 with 0 being no change

************************************
[10635] MovieClip(mode, startPosition, loop, labels, style, group, inherit)

MovieClip
zim class - extends a createjs.MovieClip

DESCRIPTION
A MovieClip adds timelines to a Container.
The timelines are animate() zimTween properties.
The zimTween property returns a CreateJS Tween object.
Primarily made to support Adobe Animate MovieClip export.
*Consider this experimental for the moment...

NOTE: to use animate() on a MovieClip, add the MovieClip to a Container and animate() the Container
otherwise the animate() may advance the MovieClip.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const movieClip = new MovieClip();
const circle = new Circle(20, blue).animate({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props:{scale:3}, time:.1, rewind:true, loop:true
});

// Time is in frames NOT in ms - so 100 frames at the Ticker.framerate 60 fps by default is almost 2 seconds
// To change the Ticker's framerate use setFPS(mobile, desktop) method
// If you use one number then both mobile and desktop are set to that fps.
// The defaults are 60 fps mobile (as of ZIM Cat 04) and 60 fps desktop

movieClip.timeline.addTween(circle.zimTween);
movieClip.play();
movieClip.center();
S.on("stagemousedown", ()=&gt;{
movieClip.paused = !movieClip.paused;
});

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
// from the CreateJS MovieClip docs: http://www.createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/MovieClip.html
mode - (default "independent") or single_frame (based on startPosition) or synched (syncs to parent)
startPosition - (default 0) the start position of the MovieClip (*could not get to work)
loop - (default true) set to false not to loop (*did not seem to loop so use loop:true in zim.animate())
labels - (default null) declare label property with position value
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. {explode:20} to use with gotoAndPlay("explode") rather than gotoAndPlay(20)
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
setBounds(width||x||Boundary, height||y, null||width, null||height) - overrides CreateJS setBounds() and returns object for chaining

[10823] SVGContainer(svg, splitTypes, geometric, showControls, interactive, style, group, inherit)

SVGContainer
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Parses SVG and adds items to a ZIM Container.
Items are created as ZIM Shapes: Circle, Rectangle, Blob, Squiggle.
If geometric is true then Circle and Rectangle are used otherwise Blob is used.
Items can be accessed using svgcontainer.getChildAt(0), etc.
See: https://zimjs.com/svg/
See: https://zimjs.com/explore/svgcontainer.html

ALSO: see SVG() class under Frame module.

An SVG path string can be passed directly to a Squiggle or Blob points parameter
and so avoiding the SVGContainer - see ZIM Squiggle and Blob

WARNING: this should be considered experimental
The idea is that paths from SVG can be made editable in ZIM
or animation, dragging, or Label along paths can be accommodated
As such, not all SVG features will work - no CSS, Text, Gradients, DropShadows, etc.
It is possible that these will be added at some point
See also the ZIM svgToBitmap() function under META to get an exact image of the SVG
Thank you https://github.com/colinmeinke/svg-arc-to-cubic-bezier for the Arc conversion

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const svgContainer = new SVGContainer(asset("sample.svg")).addTo();

// OR

const svg = `&lt;svg  width="150" height="200" xmlns="h t t p ://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
&lt;path id="lineAB" d="M 0 0 l 150 200" stroke="red" stroke-width="3" fill="none" /&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;`;
const svgContainer = new SVGContainer(svg).center();

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)

group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
processPath(path) - path is an SVG path string - returns a ZIM Blob or Squiggle points array

dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),

************************************
[11883] CustomShape(x, y, w, h)

CustomShape
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Used internally to make ZIM Shapes - Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, etc.
Holds the following properties in common:
color, colorRange, borderColor, borderWidth, thickness, dashed, dashedOffset, corner
Holds the following functions in common:  (most methods applied through ZIM 4TH methods)
setColorRange, cloneAll(), linearGradient (depreciated), radialGradient (depreciated)

NOTE: this is NOT a generic Shape - see the zim.Shape() class for that.

EXAMPLE
// would recommend just extending a Container() for custom shapes / objects
// unless properties listed above are needed over multiple projects
// but it could be done with matching various private properties, etc.
// also note that a Blob can make just about any shape...
const Smile = function(color) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.super_constructor(-100,-20,200,70);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this._color = color;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.shape = new Shape().addTo(this);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// this is an example of how ZIM changes shape color
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// will need to go through and do similar things for borderColor, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.colorCommand = this.shape.f(this._color).command;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.shape.mt(-100,-20).bt(0,70,0,70,100,-20);
}
extend(Smile, CustomShape);

const s = new Smile(red).center();

************************************
[12116] Circle(radius, color, borderColor, borderWidth, dashed, percent, percentClose, strokeObj, style, group, inherit)

Circle
zim class - extends a zim.CustomShape which extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Makes a circle shape inside a container.
The registration and origin will be the center.
NOTE: mouseChildren is turned to false for all zim Shape containers.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
new Circle(50, red).center();

// or with 10 pixel grey stroke
const circle = new Circle(50, red, grey, 10).center();

// change the color of the circle to a radial gradient fill
circle.color = new RadialColor([yellow,green], [0, .7], 0, 0, 20, 0, 0, 50);

// make a half circle - or any percent of a circle
new Circle({radius:200, color:pink, percent:50}).center();

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle({min:10, max:50}, [red, green, blue]).center();
interval(1, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// apply a different values picked from original ZIM VEE values
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(circle.veeObj)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.radius = Pick.choose(circle.veeObj.radius); // or zik(circle.veeObj.radius)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.color = Pick.choose(circle.veeObj.color);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
radius - |ZIM VEE| (default 50) the radius (from the center to the edge or half the diameter) ;-)
color - |ZIM VEE| (default black) the fill color as any CSS color including "rgba()" for alpha fill (set a to 0 for tranparent fill)
borderColor - |ZIM VEE| (default null) the stroke color
borderWidth - |ZIM VEE| (default 1 if stroke is set) the size of the stroke in pixels
dashed - (default false) set to true for dashed border (if borderWidth or borderColor set)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or set to an array of line size then space size, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. [20, 10] is 20 line and 10 space repeated and [20,100,50,10] is 20 line, 100 space, 50 line, 10 space, etc.
percent - (default 100) set to a percentage of a circle (arc) - registration stays at radius center, bounds shrink to arc
percentClose - (default true) set to false to not close the border of a circle with percent set
strokeObj - (default {caps:"butt", joints:"miter", miterLimit:10, ignoreScale:false}) set to adjust stroke properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// note, not all applicable to a Circle - perhaps just ignoreScale...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caps options: "butt", "round", "square" or 0,1,2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;joints options: "miter", "round", "bevel" or 0,1,2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miterLimit is the ration at which the mitered joint will be clipped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignoreScale set to true will draw the specified line thickness regardless of object scale
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
setColorRange(color1, color2) - set a color range for shape - used by colorRange property - returns obj for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if one color is used, the current color is used and color1 is the second color in the range
cache(see Container docs for parameter description) - overrides CreateJS cache() and returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave parameters blank to cache bounds of shape (plus outer edge of border if borderWidth &gt; 0)
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone(exact) - makes a copy of the shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exact (default false) ZIM VEE (Pick) values are active in clones unless exact is set to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, if the object's color is [blue, green]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then its clone might be blue or green - which could be different than the original
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If exact is set to true then the clone will be the color of the original object
cloneAll(exact, style, group, inherit) - copies shape and any custom content in shape - experimental - usually shapes do not have content (use a Container)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exact (default false) in theory will copy ZIM VEE values as they are in the original
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see main class for style, group, inherit parameters
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:
on(), off(), getBounds(), setBounds(), uncache(), updateCache(), dispatchEvent(),
addChild(), removeChild(), addChildAt(), getChildAt(), contains(), removeAllChildren(), etc.

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
shape - gives access to the circle shape
color - get and set the fill color
colorRange - if setColorRange() is used, the colorRange is a ratio (0-1) between the colors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting the colorRange will change the color property of the shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for instance, shape.setColorRange(blue, pink) then shape.colorRange = .5
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will set the color of the shape to half way between blue and pink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shape.animate({color:red}, 1); is a shortcut to animate the colorRange
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shape.wiggle("colorRange", .5, .2, .5, 1, 5) will wiggle the colorRange
colorCommand - access to the CreateJS fill command for bitmap, linearGradient and radialGradient fills
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depreciated - see ZIM GradientColor, RadialColor and BitmapColor
borderColor - get and set the stroke color
borderColorCommand - access to the CreateJS stroke command for bitmap, linearGradient and radialGradient strokes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See: https://www.createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/Graphics.Stroke.html
borderWidth - get and set the stroke size in pixels
borderWidthCommand - access to the CreateJS stroke style command (width, caps, joints, miter, ignoreScale)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See: https://www.createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/Graphics.StrokeStyle.html
dashed - get and set the dashed - use true / false or an array (see dashed parameter)
dashedOffset - get and set the offset of the dash (50 default) - can animate this property for a marquee effect
borderDashedCommand - access to the CreateJS stroke dashed command (segments, offset)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see https://www.createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/Graphics.StrokeDash.html
radius - gets or sets the radius.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radius is independent of scaling and can be different than the width/2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting the radius redraws the circle but any current scaling is kept
percentage - get or set the percent of the circle (see percent parameter)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE not percent property which interferes with animate percent

************************************
[12361] Rectangle(width, height, color, borderColor, borderWidth, corner, dashed, strokeObj, scaleDimensions, style, group, inherit)

Rectangle
zim class - extends a zim.CustomShape which extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Makes a rectangle shape inside a container.
The registration and origin will be top left corner.
NOTE: mouseChildren is turned to false for all zim Shape containers.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
new Rectangle(200, 100, blue).center();

// or with rounded corners
new Rectangle({width:200, height:100, color:blue, corner:20}).center();

// or with individual corners
new Rectangle({width:100, height:100, corner:[50,0,50,0]}).center();

// or with skewed corners
// this will have a radius of 50 in the horizontal but 20 in the vertical
new Rectangle({width:100, height:100, corner:[50,20]}).center();

// or a combination of corner values and skewed values
new Rectangle({width:100, height:100, corner:[0, 50, [10,50], [40, 20]}).center();

// or with 2 pixel white stroke
new Rectangle(200, 100, blue, white, 2).center();

// fill the rectangle with a Bitmap fill assuming icon has been loaded - not the image property
new Rectangle(200, 300, new BitmapColor(new Pic("icon.png"))).center();

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
width - |ZIM VEE| (default the height if provided else 100) the width
height - |ZIM VEE| (default the width if provided else 100) the height
color - |ZIM VEE| (default black) the fill color as any CSS color including "rgba()" for alpha fill (set a to 0 for tranparent fill)
borderColor - |ZIM VEE| (default null) the stroke color
borderWidth - |ZIM VEE| (default 1 if stroke is set) the size of the stroke in pixels
corner - (default 0) the round of corner
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can also be an array of [topLeft, topRight, bottomRight, bottomLeft]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can also be an array of [horizontal, vertical] which skews each corner
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can also be a combination array of values and skew arrays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[topLeft, [horizontal, vertical], bottomRight, [horizontal, vertical]]
dashed - (default false) set to true for dashed border (if borderWidth or borderColor set)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or set to an array of line size then space size, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. [20, 10] is 20 line and 10 space repeated and [20,100,50,10] is 20 line, 100 space, 50 line, 10 space, etc.
strokeObj - (default {caps:"butt", joints:"miter", miterLimit:10, ignoreScale:false}) set to adjust stroke properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caps options: "butt", "round", "square" or 0,1,2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;joints options: "miter", "round", "bevel" or 0,1,2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miterLimit is the ration at which the mitered joint will be clipped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignoreScale set to true will draw the specified line thickness regardless of object scale
scaleDimensions - (default true) set to false to redraw the shape rather than scale the shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when using width, height widthOnly, and heightOnly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a false setting will keep the corner and the borderWidth the same size
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
setColorRange(color1, color2) - set a color range for shape - used by colorRange property - returns obj for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if one color is used, the current color is used and color1 is the second color in the range
cache(see Container docs for parameter description) - overrides CreateJS cache() and returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave parameters blank to cache bounds of shape (plus outer edge of border if borderWidth &gt; 0)
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone(exact) - makes a copy of the shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exact (default false) ZIM VEE (Pick) values are active in clones unless exact is set to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, if the object's color is [blue, green]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then its clone might be blue or green - which could be different than the original
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If exact is set to true then the clone will be the color of the original object
cloneAll(exact style, group, inherit) - copies shape and any custom content in shape - experimental - usually shapes do not have content (use a Container)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exact (default false) in theory will copy ZIM VEE values as they are in the original
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see main class for style, group, inherit parameters
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:
on(), off(), getBounds(), setBounds(), uncache(), updateCache(), dispatchEvent(),
addChild(), removeChild(), addChildAt(), getChildAt(), contains(), removeAllChildren(), etc.

Triangle
zim class - extends a zim.CustomShape which extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Makes a triangle shape inside a container using three line lengths.
Passing one length parameter makes an equilateral triangle.
Passing two length parameters makes an isosceles triangle.

Poly
zim class - extends a zim.CustomShape which extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Makes a regular polygon with radius like a Circle.
The number of sides can be set as well as a pointSize that will make star-like shapes
The registration and origin will be the center.
NOTE: mouseChildren is turned to false for all zim Shape containers.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
new Poly(200, 5, 0, pink).center(); // pentagon

new Poly(200, 5, .6, pink).center(); // five point star

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below

sides - |ZIM VEE| (default 5) the number of sides
pointSize - |ZIM VEE| (default 0) a factor that will indent or outdent the sides to form stars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 is no indent - 1 is a complete indent - which will have no fill and if there is a border will look like a stick figure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beyond 1 is cool - it overlaps on itself and makes multiple patterns
color - |ZIM VEE| (default black) the fill color as any CSS color including "rgba()" for alpha fill (set a to 0 for tranparent fill)
borderColor - |ZIM VEE| (default null) the stroke color
borderWidth - |ZIM VEE| (default 1 if stroke is set) the size of the stroke in pixels

dashed - (default false) set to true for dashed border (if borderWidth or borderColor set)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or set to an array of line size then space size, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. [20, 10] is 20 line and 10 space repeated and [20,100,50,10] is 20 line, 100 space, 50 line, 10 space, etc.
strokeObj - (default {caps:"butt", joints:"miter", miterLimit:10, ignoreScale:false}) set to adjust stroke properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caps options: "butt", "round", "square" or 0,1,2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;joints options: "miter", "round", "bevel" or 0,1,2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miterLimit is the ration at which the mitered joint will be clipped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignoreScale set to true will draw the specified line thickness regardless of object scale
lineType - (default "straight") - by default the line is a straight line between points
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to "corner" to draw only horizontal and vertical lines at 90 degree angles between lines (see lineOrientation)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to "curve" to draw horizontal and vertical lines with curves between lines (see lineOrientation)
lineOrientation - (default AUTO) - for lineType other than straight automatically decide between horizontal or vertical
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to HORIZONTAL to draw two horizontal lines and one vertical line between points
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to VERTICAL to draw two vertical lines and one horizontal line between points
curveH - (default 100) - for "curve" lineType this is the horizontal distance of the curve
curveV - (default 100) - for "curve" lineType this is the vertical distance of the curve
points - (default null) an Array of points for the line which will ignore length and lineType parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;points in the array can have the following formats (a mix is okay too):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[x,y] points for straight lines.  This format should also be used for first point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[cpX, cpY, x, y] for quadratic curve to with a single control point followed by the destination point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[cp1X, cp1Y, cp2X, cp2Y, x, y] for Bezier curve to with start and end control points followed by the destination point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// see the ZIM Shape docs (or https://www.createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/Graphics) for details on the curves
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
setPoints(a, b, c, d) - pass in two ZIM Points or four numbers to set start points and end points or an array of points
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will not change the x and y of the shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see startPoint, endPoint, startX, startY, endX, endY properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if an array is used the points are remade like when made with the points parameter
from(a, b, localToLocal) - pass in a ZIM Point or two numbers to set the start point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a DisplayObject is passed in then it will locate the point adjusting for coordinate space (unless localToLocal is false)
to(a, b, localToLocal) - pass in a ZIM Point or two numbers to set the end point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a DisplayObject is passed in then it will locate the point adjusting for coordinate space (unless localToLocal is false)
setColorRange(color1, color2) - set a color range for shape - used by colorRange property - returns obj for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if one color is used, the current color is used and color1 is the second color in the range
cache(see Container docs for parameter description) - overrides CreateJS cache() and returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave parameters blank to cache bounds of shape (plus outer edge of border if borderWidth &gt; 0)
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone(exact) - makes a copy of the shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exact (default false) ZIM VEE (Pick) values are active in clones unless exact is set to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, if the object's color is [blue, green]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then its clone might be blue or green - which could be different than the original
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If exact is set to true then the clone will be the color of the original object
cloneAll(exact style, group, inherit) - copies shape and any custom content in shape - experimental - usually shapes do not have content (use a Container)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exact (default false) in theory will copy ZIM VEE values as they are in the original
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see main class for style, group, inherit parameters
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.

[13775] Squiggle(color, thickness, points, length, controlLength, controlType, lockControlType, showControls, lockControls, handleSize, allowToggle, move, dashed, onTop, circleColor, circleBorderColor, stickColor, stickThickness, selectColor, selectPoints, editPoints, interactive, strokeObj, style, group, inherit)

Squiggle
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Makes a squiggly line with a number of points.
The points have Bezier controls - little handles that change the shape of the line.
The type of control can be specified overall and individually - and can be hidden or shown
The type of control can be changed by double clicking the point - colors of the handles will change
Points can be added by clicking on the line or removed by SHIFT clicking a point.
CTRL Z will undo adding or removing a point
The shape of the line can be recorded with the recordData() method and recreated with the setData() method
The Squiggle is set by default to show and hide controls when clicked
It is also draggable by default when the controls are showing
It can be set to copy with a shift click

SEE:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2hDe5JCINY for Blob and Squiggle Basics

MULTIPLE SELECT
Multiple points can be selected with the CTRL key held and then dragged
or moved with the keyboard arrows (moves 10 pixels with shift key down)

NOTE: mouseChildren is turned to false for all zim Shape containers.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
new Squiggle().center(); // makes a line with default 4 points with Bezier controls
new Squiggle({points:2, controlType:"none"}).pos(100,100); // makes a diagonal straight line that is editable

EXAMPLE
// Animate along a Squiggle
// see https://zimjs.com/explore/squiggleAnimate.html for more
const line = new Squiggle().center();
new Circle(10, red).addTo().animate({path:line}, 1);

EXAMPLE
// there are so many examples for Blob and Squiggle
// see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2hDe5JCINY
// In this set of examples we show editing which is new in ZIM NFT

// Add a new second smaller part to the Squiggle
// reverse points from right to left and animate along Squiggle
const s = new Squiggle({showControls:false}).center();
const s2 = new Squiggle()
.transformPoints("scale", .5)
.transformPoints("x", s.width);
s.appendPoints(s2.points).reversePoints();
new Circle(10).addTo().animate({path:s}, 5);

EXAMPLE
// split Squiggle and change color of second part
const s1 = new Squiggle().center();
const s2 = s1.splitPoints(2);
s2.color = red;

EXAMPLE
// split Blob into Squiggles
const b1 = new Blob().center();
const s1 = b1.makeSquiggle(0).loc(b1);
const s2 = s1.splitPoints(2).loc(b1);
s2.color = red;
b1.removeFrom();

// // and put back again
// s1.appendPoints(s2.points, "mirror");
// const b2 = s1.makeBlob().loc(s1);
// b2.color = blue;
// b2.borderColor = null;
// s1.removeFrom();
// s2.removeFrom();

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
color - |ZIM VEE| - (default green) the line color as any CSS color including "rgba()" for alpha
thickness - (default 2) the thickness of the line in pixels
points - (default 5) a number of points to start with to make the shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR an SVG path like: points:"M0,129.5c22,0,40-31,40-41c0-8-3.2-13-10-13" etc. (also see SVGContainer)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR an array of points as follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[[controlX, controlY, circleX, circleY, rect1X, rect1Y, rect2X, rect2Y, controlType], [etc]]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controlX and controlY - the x and y location of the control Container which holds the point circle and the two control rectangles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rect1X, rect1Y, rect2X, rect2Y - (default based on controlLength) the x and y location of the control rectangles relative to the control location
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circleX and circleY - (default 0) the x and y location of the circle relative to the control location (usually 0, 0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controlType - (default main controlType parameter or "straight" if not controlType parameter) the point's controlType "none", "mirror", "straight" or "free"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;custom points will start with approximateBounds() called
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but approximateBounds() must be called manually anytime afterwards when new bounds are desired.
length - (default 300) the default length of line used to create the squiggle (also specifies the squiggle's bounds(0, 0, length, thickness))
controlLength - |ZIM VEE| (default radius*numPoints/4) specify a Number to override the calculated default
controlType - (default "straight") one of four String values as follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;none - there are no control rectangles (they are actually set at 0,0).  This makes a corner at the circle point.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mirror - the control rectangles reflect one another about the point circle - lengths are kept even
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;straight - the control rectangles keep a straight line through the point circle but length is independent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free - the control rectangle moves independently from the other control rectangle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** The controlType can be specified for each point - see the points parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** The controlType can be changed by doubleClicking the point circle to cycle through the controls in the order above - unless the lockControlType is set to true
lockControlType - (default false) set to true to disable doubleClicking of point circles to change controlType
showControls - (default true) set to false to start with controls not showing - can change this after with controlsVisible property or showControls() and hideControls() methods
lockControls - (default false) set to true to lock the editing of controls - can't move the points or handles - but can see them if showControls is set to true
handleSize - (default 20 mobile 10 for non-mobile) the size of control boxes and affects the circles too proportionally
allowToggle - (default true) set false to let turn off clicks showing and hiding controls
move - (default true) set to false to disable dragging when controls are showing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can also set to "always" to allow movement when controls are not showing
dashed - (default false) set to true for dashed border (if borderWidth or borderColor set)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or set to an array of line size then space size, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. [20, 10] is 20 line and 10 space repeated and [20,100,50,10] is 20 line, 100 space, 50 line, 10 space, etc.
onTop - (default true) set to false to not bring shape to top of container when dragging
circleColor - (default light) set the circle color of the controls
circleBorderColor - (default dark) set the circle border color of the controls
stickColor - (default darker) set the stick color of the controls
stickThickness - (default 1) set the stick thickness of the controls

selectPoints - (default true) set to false to not allow point controls to be selected for keyboard control
editPoints - (default true) lets user add points by pressing on shape path or remove points by shift click or hold
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to "anywhere" to let users add points anywhere - will add points with controlType:"none"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to false to not allow adding or removing points with shift click or hold
interactive - (default true) set to false to turn off controls, move, toggle, select, edit - leaving just the shape
strokeObj - (default {caps:"butt", joints:"miter", miterLimit:10, ignoreScale:false}) set to adjust stroke properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caps options: "butt", "round", "square" or 0,1,2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;joints options: "miter", "round", "bevel" or 0,1,2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miterLimit is the ration at which the mitered joint will be clipped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignoreScale set to true will draw the specified line thickness regardless of object scale
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
approximateBounds(num, showPoints, margin) - update the bounds based on a Rectangle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that surrounds the number of points (default 80) distributed around the object path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set showPoints to true to draw little dots on points
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;margin increases (or if negative decreases) the bounds on all sides by the margin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use outline() after object has been added to the stage to see the bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squiggles with custom points will start with approximateBounds() called
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but approximateBounds() must be called manually anytime afterwards when new bounds are desired.
addPoint(percent, controlType) - add a point at a percent (100) of the total curve
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is handy to make path have the same number of points for animate() path tweens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controlType can be as specified in main points parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns object for chaining
addPoints(num, controlType, startPoint, spread, dataOnly, points, even) - add num points between existing points
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controlType can be as specified in main points parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specify a startPoint to add points between the startPoint and the next point (one segment of points)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spread (default false) set to true to spread points evenly around path rather than evenly between segments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dataOnly and points are used internally
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns object for chaining
removePoint(index) - remove a point at the specified index
interpolate(num, startPoint, spread, points, even) - get point data {x,y} for existing points and num (default 1) points inbetween
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used with hitTestPath() and animate() drag on path - also add points (note add points does not use even:true)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specify a startPoint to get points between the startPoint and the next point (one segment of points)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spread (default false) set to true to spread number of points around path rather equal number between segments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;points (default all points) the points to work with in the same format as the points property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even (default false) set to true to use zim.Bezier() with even turned on for even percentage distribution
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns an array of point objects with x, y properties and an r property for ratio of distance along path
recordData(toJSON) - returns an object with x, y, points, color, borderColor, borderWidth, move, toggle, controls PROPERTIES to be used with setData() method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if toJSON (default false) is set to true, the return value is a JSON string
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the points data comes from the points property
setData(data, fromJSON) - sets the properties to match the data object passed in - this should come from recordData()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if fromJSON (default false) is set to true, it will assume a JSON string is passed in as data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the points data is parsed with the set setPoints() so the number of points should be the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns object for chaining
getPoints(popup) - returns an array with the same format as the points parameter - or can just use points property - also recordPoints() for backwards compatibility
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;popup - (default false) set to true to open a zim Pane (squiggle.pane) with the points in a zim TextArea (squiggle.textArea) (click off to close)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: the TextArea output uses JSON.stringify() - to add the points to the points parameter of the Squiggle use JSON.parse(output);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: using zog(JSON.stringify(squiggle.recordData()))... the console will remove the quotes from the controlTypes so those would have to be manually put back in before parse() will work
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see points property
setPoints(data) - sets the Squiggle points to the data from getPoints
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this does not remake the Squiggle but rather shifts the controls so the number of points should be the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see points property
changeControl(index, type, rect1X, rect1Y, rect2X, rect2Y, circleX, circleY, update) - change a control type and properties at an index
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accepts ZIM DUO normal parameters or configuration object literal with parameter names as propterties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passing in null as the index will change all points to the specified properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the update parameter defaults to false so set to true to show update or call update() below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is so multiple changes can be batched before calling update - for instance when animating blobs.
transformPoints(transformType, amount, x, y, approximateBounds) - scale, rotate, move points without affecting controls or borderWidth - returns object for chaining&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transformType - String any of: "scale", "scaleX", "scaleY", "rotation", "x", "y"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amount - the amount to transform
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x, y - (default 0, 0) the x and y position to transform about
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approximateBounds defaults to true - set to false to not call approximateBounds after transforming points
reversePoints() - reverse the order of the points
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this also swaps each rectangle in the Bezier controls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see the Code module for reversePoint(points) function to operate on data points in Squiggle format &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
appendPoints(points, controlType) - add points at end of points - updates Squiggle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is assumed that the first point of the new points is in the same place as the last point of the Squiggle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by default these will transfer control types but can override with controlType
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will not have immediate effect but will be triggered when the joining point handle is moved&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
prependPoints(points, controlType) - add points at start of points - updates Squiggle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is assumed that the last point of the new points is in the same place as the first point of the Squiggle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by default these will transfer control types but can override with controlType
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will not have immediate effect but will be triggered when the joining point handle is moved
splitPoints(index) - breaks the Squiggle into two Squiggles at the index (length / 2)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the original Squiggle is the first Squiggle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns a reference to the second Squiggle
makeBlob(controlType, mergeDist) - makes a new Blob from the Squiggle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns the new Blob - the Squiggle remains unchanged so may need to remove it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controlType (default "free" if not merged and "mirror" if merged)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controlType for the joined end points - also see mergeDist below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will not change the control sticks until their handles are dragged
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mergeDist (default 5) merges overlapping end points (within this pixel distance)
update(normalize) - update the Squiggle if animating control points, etc. would do this in a Ticker
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set normalize (default false) to true to use pointsAdjusted for rotated and scaled points
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and if animating along the path after setting rotation or scale on point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just leave out if only animating points
showControls() - shows the controls (and returns squiggle) also see controlsVisible property
hideControls() - hides the controls (and returns squiggle) also see controlsVisible property
toggle(state - default null) - shows controls if hidden and hides controls if showing (returns the object for chaining)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or pass in true to show controls or false to hide controls
traverse(obj, start, end, time) - animates obj from start point to end point along path - thanks KV for the thought!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set start point greater than end point to traverse backwards
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will dispatch a "traversed" event when done
setColorRange(color1, color2) - set a color range for shape - used by colorRange property - returns obj for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if one color is used, the current color is used and color1 is the second color in the range
getPointAngle(index) - gets the angle made by the tangent at the index provided
getSegmentPoint(point1, point2) - returns an array of [point1, controlPoint1, controlPoint2, point2]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used internally for animating to path and adding removing Bezier points
getAdjacentSegmentData(index) - returns an array of two arrays:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is an array of cubic Bezier points for segments adjacent and including the provided point index
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each element is in the form of [point1, controlPoint1, controlPoint2, point2]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is an array of starting point indexes for the segments that were tested
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used internally to drag an animation along the path
getCurvePoint(ratio, segmentRatios, segmentPoints, getAngle) gets a point along whole curve at the ratio (0-1) provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;along with x and y values, the point has a z value that is the index of the squiggle point before the calculated point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the getAngle parameter is true (default false) the point also has an angle property which is the angle of the tangent at the point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ratio is 0-1 with 0 being at the first point and 1 being at the end of the last segment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;segmentRatios and segmentPoints will be calculated if not provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used internally for animating along the path - if lockControls is true, only animate will precalculate these values
linearGradient([colors],[ratios], x0,y0, x1,y1) - shortcut to thicknessCommand linearGradient method (see properties below)
radialGradient([colors],[ratios], x0,y0,radius0, x1,y1,radius1) - shortcut to thicknessCommand radialGradient method (see properties below)
cache(see Container docs for parameter description) - overrides CreateJS cache() and returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave parameters blank to cache bounds of shape (plus outer edge of border if borderWidth &gt; 0)
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone(exact, commands) - makes a copy of the object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exact (default false)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZIM VEE (Pick) values are active in clones unless exact is set to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, if the object's color is [blue, green]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then its clone might be blue or green - which could be different than the original
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If exact is set to true then the clone will be the color of the original object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commands (default false) makes clones with current color and borderColor commands of object
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:
on(), off(), getBounds(), setBounds(), uncache(), updateCache(), dispatchEvent(),
addChild(), removeChild(), addChildAt(), getChildAt(), contains(), removeAllChildren(), etc.

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
shape - gives access to the shape of the squiggle
color - get and set the fill color
colorRange - if setColorRange() is used, the colorRange is a ratio (0-1) between the colors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting the colorRange will change the color property of the shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for instance, shape.setColorRange(blue, pink) then shape.colorRange = .5

alpha, cursor, shadow, name, mouseChildren, mouseEnabled, parent, numChildren, etc.

EVENTS
dispatches a "change" event for when the bezier controls are adjusted (pressup only)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if monitoring constant change is needed add a pressmove event to Squiggle.controls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the change event object has a transformType property with values of "move", "bezierPoint", "bezierHandle", "bezierSwitch"
dispatches "controlsshow" and "controlshide" events when clicked off and on and toggle is true
dispatches an "update" event if the points are changed or a point is added or removed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this removes all listeners on the old shape and controls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so any custom listeners on shape and controls will need to be re-applied - use the update event to do so
dispatches a "traversed" event when traverse() is done - the event object has an obj property for the traversing object
See the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container events such as:
added, click, dblclick, mousedown, mouseout, mouseover, pressdown (ZIM), pressmove, pressup, removed, rollout, rollover

Blob
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Makes a blob shape inside a container using a number of points.
The points have Bezier controls - little handles that change the shape of the Blob.
The type of control can be specified overall and individually - and can be hidden or shown
The type of control can be changed by double clicking the point - colors of the handles will change
Points can be added by clicking on the shape or removed by SHIFT clicking a point.
CTRL Z will undo adding or removing a point
The shape of the Blob can be recorded with the recordData() method and recreated with the setData() method
The Blob is set by default to show and hide controls when clicked
It is also draggable by default when the controls are showing

MULTIPLE SELECT
Multiple points can be selected with the CTRL key held and then dragged
or moved with the keyboard arrows (moves 10 pixels with shift key down)

NOTE: mouseChildren is turned to false for all zim Shape containers.
NOTE: with the ZIM namespace zns = false, this overwrites a JS Blob - so the JS Blob is stored as document.Blob

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
new Blob().center(); // makes a circle with default 4 points with Bezier controls

new Blob({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;points:12, // 12 points for more complex shape
}).center();

new Blob({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color:purple,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controlType:"free", // free will be default control type (rather than "straight")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;points:[
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// the control position x, y
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// then three point positions inside the control - so relative to the control position
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// 1. circle position x, y (usually the same as the control position - so 0,0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// 2. the location of the first control rectangle x and y
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// 3. the location of the second control rectangle x and y
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// then an optional specific type of control that overrides the controlType parameter (or the default type of "straight")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[-100,-100,-100,100,100,-100,0,0,"mirror"], // this will be type "mirror"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[100,-100,100,0,-50,0], // this will be type "free" because controlType parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[100,100], // these will be type "none" because no dimensions (or dimensions 0) specified for controls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[-100,100]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]
}).centerReg();

EXAMPLE
// Transform the original points of a Blob
// If you rotate or scale, this affects the control points - the little rectangles rotate or they scale
// To avoid this, the points themselves can be transformed (scaleX, scaleY, scale, rotation, x, y)
// This makes a square and scales it bigger without affecting control size or stroke size (if there were a stroke)
// Note the default number of points is 4 but they are arranged at the top, bottom and sides - so would make a diamond with just controlType:"none"
new Blob({controlType:"none"}).transformPoints("rotation", 45).transformPoints("scale", 2).center();

EXAMPLE
// make a Blob the shape of basic ZIM shapes
// this overrides the path parameter
new Blob({points:"circle"}).pos(200,200);
new Blob({points:new Rectangle(100,200)}).center();
new Blob({points:new Triangle()}).transformPoints("rotation", 90).pos(50,50,true,true);

EXAMPLE
// Animate along a Blob
// see https://zimjs.com/nio/ examples
// see https://zimjs.com/explore/blobAnimate.html for more
// see https://zimjs.com/explore/blobAnimate2.html for more
const path = new Blob().center();
new Circle(10, red).addTo().animate({path:path}, 1);

EXAMPLE
// Animate one Blob into another
const targetBlob = new Blob({points:"rectangle"});
const blob = new Blob({radius:50, points:"circle", interactive:false})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.pos(200,200)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.transformPoints("rotation", -45) // to better tween to rectangle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.animate({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props:{shape:targetBlob},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time:1,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rewind:true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loop:true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});

EXAMPLE
// split Blob into Squiggles
const b1 = new Blob().center();
const s1 = b1.makeSquiggle(0).loc(b1);
const s2 = s1.splitPoints(2).loc(b1);
s2.color = red;
b1.removeFrom();

// // and put back again
// s1.appendPoints(s2.points, "mirror");
// var b2 = s1.makeBlob().loc(s1);
// b2.color = blue;
// b2.borderColor = null;
// s1.removeFrom();
// s2.removeFrom();

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
color - |ZIM VEE| - (default green) the fill color as any CSS color including "rgba()" for alpha fill (set a to 0 for tranparent fill)
borderColor - |ZIM VEE| - (default null) the stroke color
borderWidth - (default 1 if stroke is set) the size of the stroke in pixels
num - get the number of points - to set, use the points property
points - (default 4) a number of points to start with to make the shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR a shape string of "circle", "rectangle" or "triangle"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR a ZIM Circle, Rectangle, Triangle or Flare with any dimensions that will be matched
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR an SVG path like: points:"M0,129.5c22,0,40-31,40-41c0-8-3.2-13-10-13" etc. (also see SVGContainer)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR an array of points as follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[[controlX, controlY, circleX, circleY, rect1X, rect1Y, rect2X, rect2Y, controlType], [etc]]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controlX and controlY - the x and y location of the control Container which holds the point circle and the two control rectangles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circleX and circleY - (default 0) the x and y location of the circle relative to the control location (usually 0, 0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rect1X, rect1Y, rect2X, rect2Y - (default based on controlLength) the x and y location of the control rectangles relative to the control location
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controlType - (default main controlType parameter or "straight" if not controlType parameter) the point's controlType "none", "mirror", "straight" or "free"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;custom points will start with approximateBounds() called
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but approximateBounds() must be called manually anytime afterwards when new bounds are desired.
radius - (default 100) the default radius of the circle used to create the blob (also specifies the blob's bounds(-radius, -radius, radius*2, radius*2))
controlLength - |ZIM VEE| (default radius*numPoints/4) specify a Number to override the calculated default
controlType - (default "straight") one of four String values as follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;none - there are no control rectangles (they are actually set at 0,0).  This makes a corner at the circle point.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mirror - the control rectangles reflect one another about the point circle - lengths are kept even
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;straight - the control rectangles keep a straight line through the point circle but length is independent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free - the control rectangle moves independently from the other control rectangle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** The controlType can be specified for each point - see the points parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** The controlType can be changed by doubleClicking the point circle to cycle through the controls in the order above - unless the lockControlType is set to true
lockControlType - (default false) set to true to disable doubleClicking of point circles to change controlType
showControls - (default true) set to false to start with controls not showing - can change this after with control property or showControls() method
lockControls - (default false) set to true to lock the editing of controls - can't move the points or handles - but can see them if showControls is set to true
handleSize - (default 20 mobile 10 for non-mobile) the size of control boxes and affects the circles too proportionally
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a handleSize of 0 is chosen, then the sticks will disappear too
allowToggle - (default true) set false to let turn off clicks showing and hiding controls
move - (default true) set to false to disable dragging when controls are showing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can also set to "always" to allow movement when controls are not showing
dashed - (default false) set to true for dashed border (if borderWidth or borderColor set)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or set to an array of line size then space size, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. [20, 10] is 20 line and 10 space repeated and [20,100,50,10] is 20 line, 100 space, 50 line, 10 space, etc.
onTop - (default true) set to false to not bring shape to top of container when dragging
circleColor - (default light) set the circle color of the controls
circleBorderColor - (default dark) set the circle border color of the controls
stickColor - (default darker) set the stick color of the controls

selectPoints - (default true) set to false to not allow point controls to be selected for keyboard control
editPoints - (default true) lets user add points by pressing on shape path.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to "anywhere" to let users add points anywhere - will add points with controlType:"none"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to false to not allow adding or removing points with click or shift click
interactive - (default true) set to false to turn off controls, move, toggle, select, edit - leaving just the shape
strokeObj - (default {caps:"butt", joints:"miter", miterLimit:10, ignoreScale:false}) set to adjust stroke properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caps options: "butt", "round", "square" or 0,1,2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;joints options: "miter", "round", "bevel" or 0,1,2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miterLimit is the ration at which the mitered joint will be clipped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignoreScale set to true will draw the specified line thickness regardless of object scale
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
approximateBounds(num, showPoints) - update the bounds based on a Rectangle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that surrounds the number of points (default 80) distributed around the object path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set showPoints to true to draw little dots on points
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use outline() after object has been added to the stage to see the bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blobs with custom points will start with approximateBounds() called
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but approximateBounds() must be called manually anytime afterwards when new bounds are desired.
addPoint(percent, controlType) - add a point at a percent (100) of the total curve
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is handy to make path have the same number of points for animate() path tweens
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controlType can be as specified in main points parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns object for chaining
addPoints(num, controlType, startPoint, spread, dataOnly, points, even) - add num points between existing points
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controlType can be as specified in main points parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specify a startPoint to add points between the startPoint and the next point (one segment of points)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spread (default false) set to true to spread points evenly around path rather than evenly between segments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dataOnly and points are used internally
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns object for chaining
removePoint(index) - remove the point at the specified index
interpolate(num, startPoint, spread, points, even) - get point data {x,y} for existing points and num (default 1) points inbetween
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used with hitTestPath() and animate() drag on path - also add points (note add points does not use even:true)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specify a startPoint to get points between the startPoint and the next point (one segment of points)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spread (default false) set to true to spread number of points around path rather equal number between segments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;points (default all points) the points to work with in the same format as the points property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even (default false) set to true to use zim.Bezier() with even turned on for even percentage distribution
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns an array of point objects with x, y properties and an r property for ratio of distance along path
recordData(toJSON) - returns an object with x, y, points, color, borderColor, borderWidth, move, toggle, controls PROPERTIES to be used with setData() method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if toJSON (default false) is set to true, the return value is a JSON string
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the points data comes from the points property
setData(data, fromJSON) - sets the properties to match the data object passed in - this should come from recordData()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if fromJSON (default false) is set to true, it will assume a JSON string is passed in as data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the points data is parsed with the set setPoints() so the number of points should be the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns object for chaining
getPoints(popup) - returns an array with the same format as the points parameter - or can just use points property - also recordPoints() for backwards compatibility
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;popup - (default false) set to true to open a zim Pane (blob.pane) with the points in a zim TextArea (blob.textArea) (click off to close)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: the TextArea output uses JSON.stringify() - to add the points to the points parameter of the Blob use JSON.parse(output);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: using zog(JSON.stringify(blob.recordData()))... the console will remove the quotes from the controlTypes so those would have to be manually put back in before parse() will work
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see points property
setPoints(data) - sets the Blob points to the data from getPoints()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this does not remake the Blob but rather shifts the controls so the number of points should be the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see points property
changeControl(index, type, rect1X, rect1Y, rect2X, rect2Y, circleX, circleY, update) - change a control type and properties at an index
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accepts ZIM DUO normal parameters or configuration object literal with parameter names as propterties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passing in null as the index will change all points to the specified properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the update parameter defaults to false so set to true to show update or call update() below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is so multiple changes can be batched before calling update - for instance when animating blobs.
transformPoints(transformType, amount, x, y, approximateBounds) - scale, rotate, move points without affecting controls or borderWidth - returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transformType - String any of: "scale", "scaleX", "scaleY", "rotation", "x", "y"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amount - the amount to transform
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x, y - (default 0, 0) the x and y position to transform about
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;approximateBounds defaults to true - set to false to not call approximateBounds after transforming points
reversePoints(sameStart) - reverse the order of the points
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sameStart defaults to true and will keep the start point the same
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to false to make the last point before the start point, the start point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also swaps each rectangle in the Bezier controls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see the Code module for reversePoint(points) function to operate on data points in Squiggle format
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: reversing blob points with the reversePoints function will make the starting point the last point
makeSquiggle(index) - create a new Squiggle by cutting Blob at index (default 0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns the new Squiggle - the Blob remains unchanged - so may need to remove it
update(normalize) - update the Blob if animating control points, etc. would do this in a Ticker
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set normalize (default false) to true to use pointsAdjusted for rotated and scaled points
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use true for manually editing points after setting rotation or scale on point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just leave out if only animating points
showControls() - shows the controls (and returns blob) - or use  blob.controlsVisible = true property
hideControls() - hides the controls (and returns blob) - or use blob.controlsVisible = false property
toggle(state - default null) - shows controls if hidden and hides controls if showing (returns the object for chaining)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or pass in true to show controls or false to hide controls
traverse(obj, start, end, time) - animates obj from start point to end point along path - thanks KV for the thought!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set start point greater than end point to traverse backwards
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will dispatch a "traversed" event when done
setColorRange(color1, color2) - set a color range for shape - used by colorRange property - returns obj for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if one color is used, the current color is used and color1 is the second color in the range
getPointAngle(index) - gets the angle made by the tangent at the index provided
getSegmentPoint(point1, point2) - returns an array of [point1, controlPoint1, controlPoint2, point2]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used internally for animating to path and adding removing Bezier points
getAdjacentSegmentData(index) - returns an array of two arrays:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first is an array of cubic Bezier points for segments adjacent and including the provided point index
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each element is in the form of [point1, controlPoint1, controlPoint2, point2]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second is an array of starting point indexes for the segments that were tested
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used internally to drag an animation along the path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will wrap around the blob if needed
getCurvePoint(ratio, segmentRatios, segmentPoints, getAngle) gets a point along whole curve at the ratio (0-1) provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;along with x and y values, the point has a z value that is the index of the blob point before the calculated point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the getAngle parameter is true (default false) the point also has an angle property which is the angle of the tangent at the point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ratio is 0-1 with 0 being at the first point and 1 being at the end of the last segment (the first point)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;segmentRatios and segmentPoints will be calculated if not provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used internally for animating along the path - if lockControls is true, only animate will precalculate these values
linearGradient([colors],[ratios], x0,y0, x1,y1) - shortcut to colorCommand linearGradient method (see properties below)
radialGradient([colors],[ratios], x0,y0,radius0, x1,y1,radius1) - shortcut to colorCommand radialGradient method (see properties below)
cache(see Container docs for parameter description) - overrides CreateJS cache() and returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave parameters blank to cache bounds of shape (plus outer edge of border if borderWidth &gt; 0)
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone(exact, commands) - makes a copy of the object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exact (default false)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZIM VEE (Pick) values are active in clones unless exact is set to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, if the object's color is [blue, green]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then its clone might be blue or green - which could be different than the original
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If exact is set to true then the clone will be the color of the original object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commands (default false) makes clones with current color commands of object
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:
on(), off(), getBounds(), setBounds(), uncache(), updateCache(), dispatchEvent(),
addChild(), removeChild(), addChildAt(), getChildAt(), contains(), removeAllChildren(), etc.

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
shape - gives access to the shape of the blob
color - get and set the fill color
colorRange - if setColorRange() is used, the colorRange is a ratio (0-1) between the colors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting the colorRange will change the color property of the shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for instance, shape.setColorRange(blue, pink) then shape.colorRange = .5
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will set the color of the shape to half way between blue and pink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shape.animate({color:red}, 1); is a shortcut to animate the colorRange
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shape.wiggle("colorRange", .5, .2, .5, 1, 5) will wiggle the colorRange

ALSO: see ZIM Container for properties such as:
width, height, widthOnly, heightOnly, draggable, level, depth, group
blendMode, hue, saturation, brightness, contrast, etc.

ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container properties, such as:
x, y, rotation, scaleX, scaleY, regX, regY, skewX, skewY,
alpha, cursor, shadow, name, mouseChildren, mouseEnabled, parent, numChildren, etc.

EVENTS
dispatches a "change" event for when the bezier controls are adjusted (pressup only or moving with keys - thanks Yui Kim for find)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if monitoring constant change is needed add a pressmove event to Blob.sets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the change event object has a transformType property with values of "move", "bezierPoint", "bezierHandle", "bezierSwitch"
dispatches "controlsshow" and "controlshide" events when clicked off and on and toggle is true
dispatches an "update" event if the points are changed or a point is added or removed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this removes all listeners on the old shape and controls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so any custom listeners on shape and controls will need to be re-applied - use the update event to do so
dispatches a "traversed" event when traverse() is done - the event object has an obj property for the traversing object
See the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container events such as:
added, click, dblclick, mousedown, mouseout, mouseover, pressdown (ZIM), pressmove, pressup, removed, rollout, rollover

Flare
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Makes a flare shape - a shape with a gradual widening like flared pants or skirts.
The shape defaults to a horizontal rectangle flared outwardly to the right.
The flare angleA and angleB can be specified at any angle negative or positive.
The flare axis or spine can be at any angle to the horizontal positive in the x.
The cross or end angles can be specified relative to a normal the spine so 0 is -90.
Different color and border options are available and editable as properties.

More than one flare can be created in the same shape - these are called segments.
Multiple Flare objects can be easily combined into a ZIM MultiFlare
and a special FlareBox can be used to place flares or multiFlares around a rectangle
to be used for backings on buttons, pictures, etc.

See https://zimjs.com/ten/flare.html for examples of a 3D wall, a rocket and a button frame

NOTE: mouseChildren is turned to false for all zim Shape containers.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
new Flare().center();

// a Rocket
const rocket = new Flare({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thickness:100,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angles:-90, // all segment angles will point up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lengths:[40,.5,100,150,105],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anglesA:[-20,89,-12,0,-22], // anglesB will be mirrored by default
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color:new GradientColor([dark,silver,dark],[.1,.6,.9],-50,0,50,0),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cross:true // add a line at segment borders
}).center();

// see also MultiFlare and FlareBox examples

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)

color - (default black) the color of the flare
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if null and a border is speficied the color will be transparent
borderColor - (default null) the stroke color
borderWidth - (default 1 if stroke is set) the size of the stroke in pixels
crossAngle - (default 0) the angle from the normal of the spine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so if the spine goes to the right at 0 degrees then 0 crossAngle starts at -90 and goes positive clockwise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a crossAangle of -45 would look like a picture frame bevel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the flare starts at the top left corner of a rectangle
thickness - (default 20) the thickness at the start of the flare assuming 0 crossAngle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will be divided evenly to thicknessA on one side of the spine and thicknessB on the other side of the spine
thicknessA - (default null) - will be set to half the thickness if thicknessB is not set otherwise thickness-thicknessB
thicknessB - (default null) - will be set to half the thickness if thicknessA is not set otherwise thickness-thicknessA
pin - (default null) - set to a segment number to set registration point at the start of the segment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pin is used with MultiFlare to align flares at pinned segments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pin is used with FlareBox to place pinned segments at any of the four corners of the box
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When doing so, the Flare will be automatically rotated (corner number - pin number) * 90
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be overriden by rotating the flare to the desired rotation after creation
startX - (default 0) shift the start of the flare in the x from the registration point (note, pin will reset registration)
startY - (default 0) shift the start of the flare in the y from the registration point (note, pin will reset registration)
lengths - (default [200]) an array of spine lengths
angles - (default [0]) an array of angles (degrees) for the spines relative to 0 along the positive x axis
anglesA - (default [10]) an array of relative angles to the left of the current spine when heading along the spine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so if the spine heads to the right, angleA is positive from the spine upwards
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think of these as how much the shape flares out from the spine on one side
anglesB - (default anglesA) an array of relative angles to the right of the current spine when heading along the spine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so if the spine heads to the right, angleB is positive from the spine downwards
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think of these as how much the shape flares out from the spine on another side
anglesEnd - (default [0]) an array of angles at the end of each segment from the normal of each segment spine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so if the spine goes to the right at 0 degrees then a 0 anglesEnd is perpendicular to the spine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an anglesEnd of 45 would look like a picture frame bevel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the segments are placed around the picture frame clockwise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: end angles greatly change the look of flared segments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poorly chosen angles can lead to flares crossing or massively diverging
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good choices depend on the length of the flares, the spine angles and the flare angles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generally, a trial and error technique is the easiest to find the desired solution
cross - (default true) draw a crossing line at each segment - this draws each segment as a closed path
crossColors - (default null) an array of colors for each segment if cross is true
close - (default false) join the end of the last segment to the start of the first segment
dashed - (default false) set the dashed of the border if the borderColor or borderWidth is specified
strokeObj - (default {caps:"butt", joints:"miter", miterLimit:2, ignoreScale:false}) set to adjust stroke properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caps options: "butt", "round", "square" or 0,1,2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;joints options: "miter", "round", "bevel" or 0,1,2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miterLimit is the ration at which the mitered joint will be clipped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignoreScale set to true will draw the specified line thickness regardless of object scale
spineColor - (default null) as the spine is drawn, fill the shape it makes with this color
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can create a picture frame effect as the spine color may hide half the flare for each segment
spineBorderWidth - (default null) the width of the spine
spineBorderColor - (default null) the color of the actual spine
spineDashed - (default false) set to true for dashed spine (if spineBorderWidth or spineBorderColor set)
spineStrokeObj - (default strokeObject) see strokeObject parameter for details
closeColor - (default color) the color of the segment created if closing the flare
closeBorderWidth - (default borderWidth) the borderWidth of the closing segment if closing the flare
closeBorderColor - (default borderColor) the borderColor of the closing segment if closing the flare
closeDashed - (default false) set to true for dashed closed segment (if closeBorderWidth or closeBorderColor set)
closeStrokeObj - (default strokeObject) see strokeObject parameter for details
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
add(lengths, angles, anglesA, anglesB, anglesEnd, cross, crossColors, close) |ZIM DUO| - add segment(s) to the Flare - returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see segment parameters for details - returns object for chaining
remake() - remake the Flare segments after setting properties
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone(exact) - makes a copy of the shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exact (default false) ZIM VEE (Pick) values are active in clones unless exact is set to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, if the object's color is [blue, green]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then its clone might be blue or green - which could be different than the original
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If exact is set to true then the clone will be the color of the original object
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.

DESCRIPTION
Makes a Rectangle with ZIM Flare objects positioned around edges and corners.
Pass in an array of Flare objects or a MultiFlare
FlareBox places flares at specified corner indexes depending on flare pin index.
See also ZIM Flare and ZIM MultiFlare.

A FlareBox can be used as a backing and rollBacking for buttons and other components
to create exciting borders inspired by the tail lights of 2020 automibiles.

See: https://zimjs.com/ten/flare.html

NOTE: mouseChildren is turned to false for all zim Shape containers.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const border1 = new Flare({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thickness:6,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angles:[0,90], // to the right then down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lengths:[60,90],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anglesA:[3,-1.5], // flare angles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anglesEnd:[45,0], // 0 is optional
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color:white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pin:1 // pin at flare corner
});

const border2 = new Flare({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thickness:25,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angles:[0,90], // to right then down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lengths:[50,50],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anglesA:[-2,2], // anglesB will mirror these if not provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anglesEnd:[45],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color:dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pin:1 // pin at flare corner
});

// put both flares at left top corner 0
// they each have pin of 1 so
// the rotation is (0-1)*90 = -90 (counter clockwise)
// they were to the right and down
// now they are up and to the right
const flareBox = new FlareBox(220, 100, blue, dark, 3, [border1, border2], [0,0])
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.centerReg();

// clone the flares for the rollover FlareBox
// put the first flare at corner 2
// the rotation becomes (2-1)*90 = 90 (clockwise)
// it was built to go to the right and down
// now it is going down and to the left
const flareBoxOver = new FlareBox(220, 100, green, dark, 3, [border1.clone(), border2.clone()], [2,0])
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.centerReg({add:false});

// use the flareBoxes as backings
const button = new Button({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width:flareBox.width,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height:flareBox.height,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;backing:flareBox,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rollBacking:flareBoxOver
}).center();

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
width - (default 220) the width of the rectangle about which the Flare objects are placed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is a little larger than the ZIM Button default width
height - (default 80) the height of the rectangle about which the Flare objects are placed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is a little larger than the ZIM Button default height
color - (default black) the fill color as any CSS color including "rgba()" for alpha fill (set a to 0 for tranparent fill)
borderColor - (default null) the stroke color
borderWidth - (default 1 if stroke is set) the size of the stroke in pixels
flares - (default null) an array of ZIM Flare objects or a single flare or a ZIM MultiFlare
corners - (default [0]) an array of corner indexes to place the pin points of the ZIM Flare objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corner indexes are:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 - RIGHT BOTTOM
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 - LEFT BOTTOM
pins - (default null) an array of pins of the ZIM Flare objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pin index can be set on the Flare or through the MultiFlare or here in the FlareBox
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pin is also the registration point of the flare so the flare will be placed at the corner at its pin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FlareBox will also automatically rotate the flares with this formula:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flare.rotation = (corner-pin)*90
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This formula allows for easy setting of angles on corners
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the Button at https://zimjs.com/ten/flare.html
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be overridden by setting the flare rotation after the FlareBox is created
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
setColorRange(color1, color2) - set a color range for shape - used by colorRange property - returns obj for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if one color is used, the current color is used and color1 is the second color in the range
cache(see Container docs for parameter description) - overrides CreateJS cache() and returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave parameters blank to cache bounds of shape (plus outer edge of border if borderWidth &gt; 0)
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone() - makes a copy of the flareBox and clone flares as well
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
multiFlare - gives access to the ZIM Multiflare object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is made automatically by FlareBox if an array of flares was used
flares - an array of flares that belong to the multiFlare
backing - gives access to the rectangle backing shape
color - get and set the fill color of the backing shape
colorRange - if setColorRange() is used, the colorRange is a ratio (0-1) between the colors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting the colorRange will change the color property of the backing shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for instance, shape.setColorRange(blue, pink) then shape.colorRange = .5
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will set the color of the shape to half way between blue and pink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shape.animate({color:red}, 1); is a shortcut to animate the colorRange
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shape.wiggle("colorRange", .5, .2, .5, 1, 5) will wiggle the colorRange
borderColor - get and set the stroke color
borderWidth - get and set the stroke size in pixels
borderDashedCommand - access to the CreateJS stroke dashed command (segments, offset)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see https://www.createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/Graphics.StrokeDash.html
mouseChildren - set to false to avoid dragging the shape inside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to drag or interact with objects inside then set mouseChildren to true

Label
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Makes a label - wraps the createjs Text object.
Can use with Button, CheckBox, RadioButtons and Pane.
Text seems to come in different sizes so we do our best.
Have tended to find that left and alphabetic are most consistent across browsers.
Custom fonts loaded through css can be used as well.

NOTE: can wrap text at given width using lineWidth (or labelWidth) parameter.
To dynamically change the width without changing the font size use the labelWidth property.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
new Label("Hello").center(); // adds label to and centers on the stage

new Label({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text:"CLICK",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;size:100,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font:"courier",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color:white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rollColor:red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bold:true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;italic:true
}).loc(100,100).tap(()=&gt;{zog("tapping");});

EXAMPLE
// with text that wraps at labelWidth
// can also set this as a property later to dynamically change width of text
// without changing the size
new Label({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text:"this is a long bunch of text, this is a long bunch of text, this is a long bunch of text",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;labelWidth:200
}).center();

EXAMPLE
STYLE = {font:"courier"};
new Label("Hi Courier").center(); // will be courier not arial

STYLE = {text:"YAY!", color:red};
new Label().center().mov(0,100); // will say YAY! in red arial font
new Label("Hello").center().mov(0,200); // will say Hello in red arial

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function

text |ZIM VEE| - String for the the text of the label
size - (default 36) the size of the font in pixels
font - (default arial) the font or list of fonts for the text
color - (default black) color of font (any CSS color)
rollColor - (default color) the rollover color of the font
shadowColor - (default -1) for no shadow - set to any css color to see
shadowBlur - (default 14) if shadow is present
align - ((default LEFT) text registration point alignment also CENTER/MIDDLE and RIGHT
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to START to align LEFT for ZIM DIR constant is "ltr" or RIGHT when DIR="rtl" - END is the opposite
valign - (default TOP) vertical registration point alignment alse CENTER/MIDDLE, BOTTOM
bold - (default false) set the font to bold - note: fontOptions has been removed as of ZIM Cat
italic - (default false) set the font to italic - note: fontOptions has been removed as of ZIM Cat
variant - (default false) set to true to set the font to "small-caps" - note: fontOptions has been removed as of ZIM Cat
lineWidth - (default false) for no wrapping (use \n) Can set to number for wrap
lineHeight - (default getMeasuredLineHeight) set to number to adjust line height
backing - (default null) a Display object for the backing of the label (eg. Shape, Bitmap, Container, Sprite)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the backing most likely should be centerReg() ie. backing:new Rectangle(200,50,yellow).centerReg()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see ZIM Pizzazz module for a fun set of Shapes like Boomerangs, Ovals, Lightning Bolts, etc.
outlineColor - (default null - or black if outlineWidth set) - the color of the outline of the text
outlineWidth - (default null - or (size*.2) if outlineColor set) - the thickness of the outline of the text
backgroundColor - (default null) set to CSS color to add a rectangular color around the label
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The background color will change size to match the text of the label
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: the backgroundColor is different than a backing which can be any Display Object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and background parameters are ignored if a backing parameter is set
backgroundBorderColor - (default null) the background stroke color
backgroundBorderWidth - (default null) thickness of the background border
corner - (default 0) the round of corner of the background if there is one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can also be an array of [topLeft, topRight, bottomRight, bottomLeft]
backgroundDashed - (default null) set to true for dashed background border (if backgroundBorderColor or backgroundBorderWidth set)
padding - (default 10 if backgroundColor set) places the border this amount from text (see paddingH and paddingV)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;padding parameters are ignored if there is no backgroundColor set (also ignored if a backing parameter is set)
paddingH - (default padding) places border out at top bottom
paddingV - (default padding) places border out at left and right
shiftH - (default 0) move the label (CreateJS Text) inside the Label container horizontally
shiftV - (default 0) move the label (CreateJS Text) inside the Label container vertically
rollPersist - (default false) set to true to maintain rollover stage as long as mousedown or press is activated (used by Buttons)
labelWidth - (default null) the same as the lineWidth - the text will wrap at the labelWidth (added to match labelHeight)
labelHeight - (default null) the height of the text - setting this will probably alter the font size - so the size parameter is overwritten
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for labelHeight to work, the labelWidth must also be set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;using labelWidth and labelHeight together allow you to fit as much text into specified width and height dimensions
maxSize - (default null) set to limit the font size when using labelWidth and labelHeight
splitWords - (default false) set to true when lineWidth &gt; 0 to split words at the line width
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
setColorRange(color1, color2) - set a color range for label - used by colorRange property - returns obj for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if one color is used, the current color is used and color1 is the second color in the range
showRollColor(visible) - default true to show roll color (used internally)
cache(see Container docs for parameter description) - overrides CreateJS cache() and returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave parameters blank to cache bounds of shape (plus outer edge of border if borderWidth &gt; 0)
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone(exact) - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exact (default false) ZIM VEE (Pick) values are active in clones unless exact is set to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, if the object's color is [blue, green]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then its clone might be blue or green - which could be different than the original
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If exact is set to true then the clone will be the color of the original object
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will set the color of the label to half way between blue and pink
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;label.animate({color:red}, 1); is a shortcut to animate the colorRange
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;label.wiggle("colorRange", .5, .2, .5, 1, 5) will wiggle the colorRange
rollColor - gets or sets the label rollover color

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: setting groupStyle will make letter from scratch as opposed to building on the submitted label styles
align - (default CENTER) set to LEFT, CENTER / MIDDLE, RIGHT for letter registration x positioning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see lineAlign for alignment of lines
valign - (default CENTER) set to TOP, CENTER / MIDDLE, "bottom" for letter registration y positioning

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to use letterSpacing and a backgroundColor use the backing parameter of Label instead of backgroundColor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or use letterSpacings (see below) to set specific spacings (kerning) on letters
letterSpacings - (default null) - an array of the space between letters each letter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any value here will override the letterSpacing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 is the index for the space between first and second letter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the length of this should be one less than the number of letters
lineSpacing - (default 5) - the space between lines (not including lineHeight)
lineSpacings - (default null) - an array of the space between lines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any values here will override the lineSpacing

rtl - (default false) set to true to reverse letters other than a-zA-Z0-9 and set default lineAlign to RIGHT
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone() - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied

[20991] Emoji(code, size, monochrome, italic, backgroundColor, backgroundBorderColor, backgroundBorderWidth, corner, backing, padding, paddingH, paddingV, shiftH, shiftV, style, group, inherit)

Emoji
zim class - extends a zim.Label which extends a zim.Container

DESCRIPTION
Shows an emoji in a Label - an emoji is just text.
This helps treat the emoji as an image and works in conjunction with ZIM EmojiPicker

SEE: ZIM EmojiPicker() in COMPONENTS below ColorPicker().

SEE: https://zimjs.com/nft/bubbling/emoji.html

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// Go to https://emojipedia.org/ and find an emoji page
// copy the emoji or use the copy link and paste into the string below
new Emoji("paste the unicode icon here in string")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.drag();

EXAMPLE
// or use UTF code from https://zimjs.com/emoji
new Emoji("\ud83c\udf47") // grapes using UTF codes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.drag();

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
code |ZIM VEE| - (default \ud83d\ude42") the Unicode Character or the Emoji from https://emojipedia.org/
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or pass in UTF codes such as "\ud83d\ude42".
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To convert from Unicode to UTF use https://zimjs.com/emoji/ (also see MORE link at bottom of page)
size |ZIM VEE| - (default 36) the size of the font in pixels
monochrome - (default false) set to true to make black outline - this is actually the bold version of the icon
italic - (default false) set the font to italic
** SEE Label for the rest of the definitions
backgroundColor, corner, backing, padding, paddingH, paddingV, shiftH, shiftV, style, group, inherit
backgroundColor - (default null) set to CSS color to add a rectangular color around the label
The background color will change size to match the text of the label
Note: the backgroundColor is different than a backing which can be any Display Object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and background parameters are ignored if a backing parameter is set
backgroundBorderColor - (default null) the background stroke color
backgroundBorderWidth - (default null) thickness of the background border
corner - (default 0) the round of corner of the background if there is one
can also be an array of [topLeft, topRight, bottomRight, bottomLeft]
backing - (default null) a Display object for the backing of the emoji (eg. Shape, Bitmap, Container, Sprite)
the backing most likely should be centerReg() ie. backing:new Rectangle(200,50,yellow).centerReg()
see ZIM Pizzazz module for a fun set of Shapes like Boomerangs, Ovals, Lightning Bolts, etc.
padding - (default 10 if backgroundColor set) places the border this amount from emoji (see paddingH and paddingV)
padding parameters are ignored if there is no backgroundColor set (also ignored if a backing parameter is set)
paddingH - (default padding) places border out at top bottom
paddingV - (default padding) places border out at left and right
shiftH - (default 0) move the emoji inside the container horizontally
shiftV - (default 0) move the emoji inside the container vertically
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
clone() - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

Button
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Makes a button with rollover and many more features - see parameters.
You will need to pass in a Label to change the font properties of the button from the default.
You will then need to add the button to the stage and add a mousedown or click event.
Button rollover is done automatically.

Generally, there are three modes for a button - normal, toggle and wait.
Each of these have backgroundColor, color, backing and icon displays
and each of these have up (normal), roll and down states.
Down states were added in ZIM ZIM 01
SEE https://zimjs.com/zim/button.html

DISPLAYS FOR NORMAL MODE WITH THREE STATES EACH
backgroundColor, rollBackgroundColor, downBackgroundColor,
color, rollColor, downColor,
backing, rollBacking, downBacking,
icon, rollIcon, downIcon

** The normal mode also has borderColor, borderWidth, rollBorderColor and downBorderColor inserted after the color set.

The parameters are kept flat rather than grouped in {} object parameters in order to use ZIM DUO and STYLE

The button parameters have indicators showing the subsections
The normal mode is listed first, then general Button parameters such as corner, shadowColor, etc.
The toggle and wait parameters are listed last.

You can set a backing display object (Shape, Bitmap, Pattern, etc.) in place of the standard rectangle.
You can set an icon display object in place of the standard text
You can set the Button to toggle between text, backings or icons
SEE the ZIM Pizzazz series for a growing selection of backings, patterns and icons
https://zimjs.com/bits/view/pizzazz.html
https://zimjs.com/bits/view/icons.html
https://zimjs.com/patterns.html

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
new Button(200,60,"CLICK").center().tap(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog("clicking");
});

// OR add custom label (needed to change label color for instance)
const label = new Label({

METHODS
setBacking(type, newBacking) - dynamically set any type of backing for button (if null removes backing for that type)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backing types are: "backing", "rollBacking", "downBacking", "toggleBacking", "rollToggleBacking", "downToggleBacking", "waitBacking", "rollWaitBacking", "downWaitBacking"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note - all backing will have a pattern property if a pattern is set as a backing

toggle(state) - forces a toggle of label, backing and icon if set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;state defaults to null so just toggles if left blank
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass in true to go to the toggled state and false to go to the original state
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns object for chaining
removeRoll() - force rollover state off
wait() - forces a wait state - with wait text, backings and icons if set
clearWait() - clears a wait state of the button - sets it back to normal
removeWait() - removes (and clears) a wait state of the button so it will not trigger again
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone(exact) - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exact - will ignore ZIM VEE values and clone the original values

inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
show(delay, time) - show the tip - delay in s defaults to 0 and time in s defaults to 2 (also see ZIM TIME constant)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;default delay and time can be set with main default and time parameters for Tip()

Adds a window for alerts, etc.
You need to call the pane.show() to show the pane and pane.hide() to hide it.
You do not need to add it to the stage - it adds itself centered.
You can change the x and y (the origin and registration point are in the middle).

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
new Pane("Watch out!", yellow).show(); // pressing anywhere will close pane (see parameters for options)

This component is affected by the general ACTIONEVENT setting
The default is "mousedown" - if set to something else the component will act on click (press)

EVENTS
dispatches a "closing" event when about to be closed - good for reloading a game for instance
dispatches a "close" event when closed by clicking on backing, display, close, etc. when applicable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see also call and params parameters of show() plus closeCall and closeParams properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see also params parameter of hide() which also sets the closeParams property
dispatches a "change" event when closed by clicking on backing, display, close, etc. when applicable
dispatches a "fadedin" event if fadeTime is set and pane has finished its fade in animation
dispatches a "fadedout" event if fadeTime is set and pane has finished its fade out animation

Panel
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
A simple panel with titleBar and optional arrow for more panels.
Panel can be set draggable and can have a collapse button and a close button
See: https://zimjs.com/explore/panel.html

EXAMPLE
// make a panel with two pages
const panel = new Panel({titleBar:series("TODAY", "TOMORROW")})
.center();

// content for panel 1
const today = new Circle(30, yellow);
panel.add(today,true); // center on content

// content for panel 2
const tomorrow = new Label("-30");

// event to change content as panels change
panel.on("change", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (today.parent) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;panel.add(tomorrow, true, true); // center and replace

nextPanel(index, event) - show next panel - the panels are set up to be a series or random or function based
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this means there is not necessarily an order to be able to go backwards to... so, only forward!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a series is provided to the Panel title, etc. then the index can be used to go to the title in the series at the index
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;event (default false) will dispatch a change event if nextPanel is called
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false

Window
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Adds a window for content that can be swiped and scrolled.
NOTE: if zim namespace zns = true then this overwrites a JS Window - so the JS Window is stored as document.Window

NOTE: set the enable property to false if animating the position of the whole Window
then set the enable property to true on the animate call function.  See update() method for more.

NOTE: to add ZIM Swipe() to objects in window set the overrideNoSwipe parameter of Swipe to true

NOTE: if animating the window off screen then either turn optimize:false
or use window.update() in the "animation" event with the animate({events:true})

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const w = new Window({scrollBarDrag:true, padding:20}).center();
const t = new Tile(new Circle(20, red), 4, 20, 20, 20);
w.add(t);
// the above would only drag on the circles (or the scrollbars)
// adding a Rectangle to help dragging
w.add(new Rectangle(w.width-20,t.height,dark), 0);
// or could have added it to the bottom of the Tile
// new Rectangle(w.width-20,t.height,dark).addTo(t).bot();

EXAMPLE
// Make two windows resize based on one resizeHandle
// We will use a List which extends a Window
// See https://zimjs.com/explore/splitter.html

const listWidth = 200;
const windowWidth = 600;
const margin = 50;

const list = new List({

collapseColor - (default grey) the color of the collapse icon
collapsed - (default false) set to true to start the window collapsed
optimize - (default true) set to false to not turn DisplayObjects that are not on the stage visible false
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the Window is scrolled, any objects within the content and any objects within one level of those objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are set to visible false if their bounds are not hitting the stage bounds - thanks Ami Hanya for the suggestion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see optimize property
resizeBoundary - (default null) add a ZIM Boundary() object for the resize handle - relative to the resize handle start position
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Boundary(-100, 0, 200, 0) - would allow the resize handle to move to the left or right 100 pixels but not up or down

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Boundary(-100,-100,100,100) - would allow the window to shrink in x or y 100 pixels but not grow bigger
resizeVisible - (default false) set to true to always see the resizeHandle - if resizeHandle is set to true
continuous - (default false) set to true (or VERTICAL) to lock window to vertical access and ignore boundary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or set to HORIZONTAL to lock window to horizontal and ignore boundary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used internally for when scrolling should not be limited but rather wrapped such as with ZIM List with continuous:true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will set scrollBarActive to false
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
add(obj, index, center, replace) - supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties that match parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adds obj to content container of window (at padding) must have bounds set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can add individual objects but may find it easier to make a Container with dimensions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then add and position objects in the container and add the container.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If adding individual objects and adjusting their x and y or scale, do so first and then add()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or if adjusting after adding and the object goes outside the window size then you should call update()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which will reset the scrollbars.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;index is the level or layer in the content with 0 being at the bottom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;center will center the content in the visible window
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replace defaults to false and if set to true, removes all content then adds the obj.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns window for chaining
remove(obj) - removes object from content container of window and updates - returns window for chaining
removeAll() - removes all objects from content container of window and updates - returns window for chaining
resize(width, height) - resizes the Window without scaling the content (also calls update() for scroll update)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width and height are optional - returns window for chaining
update() - resets window scrolling if perhaps the content gets bigger or smaller
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;update() does not quite update the dragBoundary due to a timeout in waiting for scrolls to be set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so if animating the position of a window, set the enable property to false before animating
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then set the enable property to true on the animate call function
cancelCurrentDrag() - stop current drag on window - but add dragging back again for next drag
fullSize(state) - state defaults to true to set window to fullsize or set to false to go back to normal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must start with the fullSize parameter set to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see fullSized property
collapse(state) - state defaults to true to collapse or set to false to expand collapsed window
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must start with the collapse parameter set to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see collapsed property
clone(recursive) - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recursive (default true) clones the window content as well (set to false to not clone content)
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:
on(), off(), getBounds(), setBounds(), cache(), uncache(), updateCache(), dispatchEvent(),
addChild(), removeChild(), addChildAt(), getChildAt(), contains(), removeAllChildren(), etc.

************************************
[25797] Page(width, height, color, color2, angle, corner, pattern, scalePattern, cache, style, group, inherit)

Page
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
ZIM Page() is a Container() with Rectangle() backing.
For years, many questions were asked - how to make a page in ZIM.
Now, we have decided to officially answer that!  ZIM Page().
An easy way to handle linear gradients is provided as well as a custom background
such as a ZIM Pizzazz pattern.

To keep things brief, Page is expected to fit the stage.
So border, corner, dashed, etc. has been left out.
If the page is smaller and these are desired...
old-school-it and make a Container and add the desired Rectangle.

SEE: https://zimjs.com/cat/page.html
SEE: Docs for ZIM Pages() as well to handle multiple pages.
SEE: ZIM Panel(), ZIM Pane() and ZIM Window() for alternatives.

NOTE A Page object will start with one child or two children if a pattern is specified.
NOTE Do not use Page with Layout as it will overlay the region backgroundColors - instead use a Container
NOTE as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const page = new Page(W, H, red, pink).addTo();
page.title = new Label("A Page!").loc(100,100,page);
page.content = new Circle().center(page);
page.nav = new Tabs().pos(0,100,CENTER,BOTTOM,page);

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
width - (default zimDefaultFrame.width) the width of the Page
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but backing is sized to screen.width if no width is provided
height - (default zimDefaultFrame.height) the height of the Page
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but backing is sized to screen.height if no height is provided
color - (default zim.light) the color of the page
color2 - (default null) a second color which would form a zim.GradientColor() as the color
angle - (default 90) the angle for the gradient if there is a gradient
pattern - (default null) a DisplayObject that will be added to the page above the backing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, import zim_pizzazz and use:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;makePattern("slants", series(grey,dark), 20, 52, 40).alp(.2)
scalePattern - (default "fill") scale the pattern so it fills the window (formerly "bigger" or "outside")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to false for no scaling or:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIT or "fit" fits inside the Page keeping proportion (formerly "smallest")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FILL or "fill" fills the Page keeping proportion (formerly "biggest" or "outside")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FULL or "full" keeps both x and y scales - may stretch object (formerly "both")
cache - (default false or true for gradient or pattern) whether the backing and pattern is cached
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
clone(recursive) - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied
recursive (default false) - set to true to copy children of the object (these will not get custom properties, no drag, events, etc.)

[25946] Layer(width, height, titleBar, titleBarContainer, backgroundColor, rollBackgroundColor, selectedBackgroundColor, selectedRollBackgroundColor, color, rollColor, selectedColor, selectedRollColor, borderWidth, borderColor, dashed, transformObject, titleBarWidth, titleBarHeight, titleBarX, titleBarY, titleBarDraggable, close, closeColor, closeBackgroundColor, closeIndicatorColor, anchor, onTop, style, group, inherit)

Layer
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Layer is a ZIM Container with transform controls.
ZIM transform() objects have their mousechildren turned off so they can be dragged and transformed.
This means there can be no interactivity inside the transformed object.
Layer provides a solution to nest transformed objects in transformable containers.
It does so by providing a titleBar that can be used to turn on and off the transform of the container
and allow its contents to be transformed when the transform controls of the Layer are turned off.
This is more than just hiding the transform tools but rather removing and adding them.

The Layer titleBar will always remain visible on the stage
If the Layer is moved (not by its titleBar) so that the titleBar hits the edge,
then the titleBar will become anchored to the edge (unless anchor is set to false)
This creates an independent titleBar that can be moved to any location.
The titleBarPos() method can also be used to separate the titleBar at any time.
Drop the titleBar on the top left corner of the Layer or doubleClick it to snap it back on to the layer

NOTE: Layers can be added to a Transform Manager and saved with the persist sytem.
NOTE: Layers can be added to Layers (nested) along with any other type of DisplayObject content.
NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

SEE: https://zimjs.com/explore/layer.html

EXAMPLE
// adding the Layers above the content will allow pressing Layer titleBar objects inside other Layers
// adding everything right on the stage would not allow pressing titleBars inside other Layers - either way may be best, depending on content
const content = new Container(W, H).addTo();
const layers = new Container(W, H).addTo();

// create an outer layer with two inner layers - one holding a circle and the other two circles
const layer0 = new Layer(800, 500, "LAYER 0", layers).center(content);
const layer1 = new Layer(300, 400, "LAYER 1", layers).loc(50,50,layer0);
const circle1 = new Circle(50, pink).center(layer1).transform({visible:false});
const layer2 = new Layer(300, 400, "LAYER 2", layers).pos(50,50,true,false,layer0);
const circle2 = new Circle(50, green).center(layer2).mov(0, -80).transform({visible:false});
const circle3 = new Circle(50, blue).center(layer2).mov(0, 80).transform({visible:false});

// optionally store transforms
const t = new TransformManager([layer0, layer1, layer2, circle1, circle2, circle3], "layersID");
// t.clearPersist("layersID")

timeout(1, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;layer2.resetTitleBar();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;layer2.turnOn();

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// if moving manually, must call resize()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;layer2.mov(30);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;layer2.resize();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
width - (default 500) the width of the Layer Container
height - (default 500) the height of the Layer Container not including the titleBar (which is not in the Container)
titleBar - (default "LAYER") a String or ZIM Label for the titleBar
titleBarContainer - (default null - zdf' stage) a container for the titleBar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can group these with other Layers and hide them all by hiding the container for instance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this also can help layer the titleBars above the content
backgroundColor - (default lighter) the background color of the titleBar
rollBackgroundColor - (default white) the roll background color of the titleBar
selectedBackgroundColor - (default granite) the selected background color of the titleBar
color - (default granite) the color of the titleBar text
rollColor - (default granite) the roll color of the titleBar text
selectedColor - (default moon) the selected color of the titleBar text
borderWidth - (default 1) the width of the ghost outline when the Layer is not selected
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to adjust the transform controls border width use the transformObject parameter and set the borderWidth property
borderColor - (default borderColor) the color of the ghost outline when the Layer is not selected
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to adjust the transform controls border color use the transformObject parameter and set the borderColor property
dashed - (default true) the dashed of the ghost outline when the Layer is not selected
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to adjust the transform controls border dashed use the transformObject parameter and set the dashed property
transformObject - (default {borderColor:selectedBackgroundColor}) any of the transform parameters as an object literal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certain properties are overwritten by Layer as follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{events:true, visible:false, ghostColor:borderColor, ghostWidth:borderWidth, ghostDashed:dashed, ghostHidden:true}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use the transformControls.show() to show the transform controls once the Layer is made for instance:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timeout(100, function(){layer.transformControls.show();}); // a timeout is needed as Layer gets created - sorry.
titleBarWidth - (default 100 + 30 if close) the width of the titleBar.  30 pixels will be added if close is true
titleBarHeight - (default 40) the height of the titleBar
titleBarX - (default null) the starting x position of the titleBar - see also titleBarPos() and resetTitleBar() methods
titleBarY - (default null) the starting y position of the titleBar - see also titleBarPos() and resetTitleBar() methods
titleBarDraggable - (default true) set to false to not let the titleBar be dragged.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is useful with the titleBarPos() to create a stationary menu for the layers - for instance along the edge like tabs
close - (default true) - set to false to not use the close checkbox
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WARNING: without the close checkbox, the user may make the layer bigger than the stage and not be able to deselect the layer
closeColor - (default selectedBackgroundColor) the border of the close checkBox
closeBackgroundColor - (default selectedBackgroundColor) the backgroundColor of the close checkBox
closeIndicatorColor - (default selectedColor) the indicator color of the close checkBox
anchor - (default true) set to false to not anchor the titleBar to the edge if dragged with the Layer (not the titleBar)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with anchor true, the user can dock the titleBar to the edges and then drag them to any desired location
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the user can snap the titleBar back on the layer by dropping it on the top left corner of the layer or double clicking the titleBar
onTop - (default true) set to false to not bring the layer on top when selected
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
titleBarPos(x, y, right, bottom) - position the titleBar in the titleBarContainer - returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will undock the titleBar from the Layer so it can be moved independently
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless titleBarDraggable is set to false
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See also titleBarX and titleBarY parameters to start titleBars at a certain position
resetTitleBar() - dock the titleBar back on the Layer - returns object for chaining
toggle(state) - toggle the controls or turn on or off the controls by providing a Boolean state - returns object for chaining
resize(dispatch) - resize the Layer and its children if Layer is manually adjusted - returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for instance, layer.x = 10; layer.resize(); otherwise, the transform controls are broken!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;normal layer transforming using the controls automatically resize.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting dispatch to true will dispatch a "transformed" event
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone() - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied (returns the new waiter for chaining)
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:
on(), off(), getBounds(), setBounds(), cache(), uncache(), updateCache(), dispatchEvent(),
addChild(), removeChild(), addChildAt(), getChildAt(), contains(), removeAllChildren(), etc.

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
transformControls - the transform transformControls object - see below for a description
anchor - get or set whether the titleBar will anchor to the edges of the titleBarContainer
toggled - read only if Layer has its transform turned on - or use transformControls.visible

TRANSFORM CONTROLS OBJECT
Layer receives a transformControls property
This may be slightly delayed as Layer is prepared on stage
var layer = new Layer().center();
timeout(100, function(){zog(layer.transformControls);}); // will probably do the trick
The transformControls property holds the following:

TRANSFORM CONTROL OBJECT PROPERTIES
visible - read only whether the controls are visible
ghost - read only as to whether the ghost outline is showing - set with showGhost and hideGhost
ghostEnabled - read only as to whether the ghost outline will be turned on and off - set with addGhost and removeGhost
scaleControls - reference to the Container that holds the corner boxes for scaling
stretchXControls - reference to the Container that holds the left and right boxes for stretching
stretchYControls - reference to the Container that holds the top and bottom boxes for stretching
rotateControls - reference to the Container that holds the outer circles for rotating

TRANSFORM CONTROL OBJECT METHODS
hide() - hides the controls - returns object for chaining
show() - shows the controls - returns object for chaining
recordData(toJSON) - returns an object with type, x, y, scaleX, scaleY, rotation, skewX, skewY, visible PROPERTIES
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if toJSON (default false) is set to true, the return value is a JSON string
setData(data, fromJSON) - sets the properties to match the data object passed in - this should come from recordData()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if fromJSON (default false) is set to true, it will assume a JSON string is passed in as data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns object for chaining
remove(noHide) - removes the controls - set noHide true if already hidden
add(noShow) - adds the controls back if then have been removed - set noShow true if not wanting to show
allowToggleOn() - sets the show / hide controls on with click
allowToggleOff() - removes the show / hide controls on with click
showGhost() - show the ghost outline - the ghostWidth or ghostColor must be set in initial parameters
hideGhost() - hide the ghost outline
toggleGhost(state) - if ghost is showing will hide ghost and if ghost is hidden will show ghost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or set state to true to show ghost or false to not show ghost
addGhost() - enable ghost outline functionality - the ghostWidth or ghostColor must be set in initial parameters
removeGhost() - disable ghost outline functionality
disable() - may show the controls if visible but cannot use them
enable() - turns the using of the controls back on
resize(dispatch) - call resize if the object is transformed in ways other than with the controls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set dispatch to true to dispatch a "transformed" event - if manually adjusted this will save to TransformManager

EVENTS
dispatches a "transformed" event when being transformed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the transformed event object has a transformType property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the transformType property has values of "size", "move", "rotate", "stretch", "reg", "reset"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the transformType also might be "resize" if resize(true) is called to dispatch a transformed event
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the transformed event object also has a pressup property that is true if on pressup and null if from pressmove
dispatches "transformshow" and "transformhide" events for when click to hide or show controls
If TransformManager() is used there are more events available such as "persistset", etc.

See the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container events such as:
added, click, dblclick, mousedown, mouseout, mouseover, pressdown (ZIM), pressmove, pressup, removed, rollout, rollover

You do not need to add it to the stage - it adds itself centered.
You can change the x and y (with origin and registration point in middle).

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const waiter = new Waiter().show(); // show the waiter until assets load
F.loadAssets("bigPic.jpg");

// the bar will show a percentage of asset bytes loaded
F.on("complete", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// the bar will be removed when loading is complete
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// must have interacted previously to play sound...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Aud("greeting.mp3").play();

width - (default 20/200 for circle/rectangle) set the width of the bar (for the circle the width is diameter)
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
show() - shows the progress bar (returns the progress bar for chaining)
hide() - hides the progress bar
toggle(state - default null) - shows progress bar if hidden and hides progress bar if showing (returns the object for chaining)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or pass in true to show progress bar or false to hide progress bar
run(time, close) - shows and runs the progress bar for the given time (default 3s) (also see ZIM TIME constant)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting close to true or false will set the main class autoHide setting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thanks Racheli Golan for the request
setBacking(backing) - change the backing of the progress bar
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone() - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied (returns the new waiter for chaining)
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

as opposed to the ZIM TextArea() which is an HTML tag overlay.
Thanks Cajoek for coding the text for the class.

WARNING: currently a single line is available (so height is not at this point useful)

See: https://zimjs.com/explore/textinput.html

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const input = new TextInput().loc(100,100); // adds a default input field to the stage

new Button({label:"SUBMIT"}).loc(100, 200).tap(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(input.text); // whatever is typed into the LabelInput

List
zim class - extends a zim.Window which extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
A vertical or horizontal list of items.
This is really a zim.Tabs object inside a zim.Window object.
The list can be strings, numbers or Label objects and these are added to Tabs buttons.
The list can also include any DisplayObject with bounds (which most ZIM objects have except a Shape needs bounds set manually with setBounds()).
If the object is not a string, number or Label then selection will not highlight and currently animateTo() may not work if size is different.
See: https://zimjs.com/explore/list.html
See: https://zimjs.com/explore/listObjects.html

ACCORDION
An accordion is a list with nested sections that expand open.
A special accordion object can be passed to the list parameter
that includes the menu items, styles for the sub menus
and properties to animate, shade and indent the sub menus.
See: https://zimjs.com/ten/accordion.html

CONTINUOUS
As of ZIM 015 a List can be made continuous
So it will continually wrap. The scrollbars will be removed for this.
See: https://zimjs.com/continuous.html

PULLDOWN AND LIST COMPONENTS
The pulldown parameter can be set to true to make list act like a pulldown
This hides the backdrop and border and can be set to be collapsed or expanded
There are component items available for slider, checkbox and colorPicker
See: https://zimjs.com/ten/pulldown.html
There is also a checkBox parameter to make a list of checkboxes
This acts like a multiple select list
See: https://zimjs.com/ten/listcheckbox.html

SPACING, PADDING, INDENTING
These adjust depending on vertical or horizontal settings
The spacing is the distance between items (default 2)
The padding is the distance around the items but not between (default spacing)
So changing the spacing can seem to change the padding - but that can be overridden
There is also paddingV and paddingH that can be adjusted (default padding)
Indent only works with custom items in the list in left, right alignment or top, bottom valignment
This moves the items away from their alignment
There is also label indenting for items with labels - and labelIndentV and labelIndentH

NOTE: List can have a ZIM Organizer added with the organizer parameter
The organizer lets the user add, remove and move items up, down, to the top or the bottom
See: https://zimjs.com/docs.html?item=organizer
See: https://zimjs.com/explore/organizer.html

NOTE: set the enable property to false as animating the position of the List object (or its parent Window)
then set the enable property to true on the animate call function.  See update() in Window docs for more

NOTE: to add ZIM Swipe() to objects in List set the overrideNoSwipe parameter of Swipe to true

NOTE: if animating the List off screen then either turn optimize:false
or use list.update() in the "animation" event with the animate({events:true})
for a List in Pages use:
pages.on("pagetransitioned", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;list.update();
});

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const list = new List({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;list:["Enormous", "Big", "Medium", "Small", "Puny"],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;viewNum:3, // this number will change the size of the list elements (default is 5)
}).center()
S.update();

EXAMPLE
// make a pulldown - this must start with a name for the list
// see https://zimjs.com/ten/pulldown.html for nested lists
const data = {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"MONSTERS":["Ghost", "Ghoul", "Vampire", "Werewolf", "Skeleton"]
}
const list = new List({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;list:{menu:data, bloom:true, whither:true},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pulldown:true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pulldownToggle:true // if want list to close when selected or stage is selected
}).center();
S.update();

EXAMPLE
// make a list with a width of 300 be resizeable
// from 100 width to 500 width
new List({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width:500,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;align:LEFT,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resizeHandle:true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resizeBoundary:new Boundary(0,0,-400,0)
}).resize(300).center()

width - (default 300) width of list
height - (default 200) height of list
list - (default Options 1-30) an array of strings, numbers or zim Label objects - these will be added to zim Tabs Buttons
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or include any DisplayObject with bounds - these will not get highlighted but will indicate a change event and selectedIndex

checkBox - (default false) set to true to turn labeled list into a list of ZIM CheckBox objects - thanks Dale789 for the prompting!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See: https://zimjs.com/ten/listcheckbox.html
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use selected.checkBox to get access to the selected CheckBox
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use the checkBoxes property to get a list of the CheckBox objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use setCheck(index, type), setChecks(type), getCheck(index) methods to manipulate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use STYLE to set CheckBox size
pulldown - (default false) set to true to have List act like a Pulldown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use tapClose and offClose parameters to optionally adjust behaviour

resizeBoundary - (default null) add a ZIM Boundary() object for the resize handle - relative to the resize handle start position
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Boundary(-100, 0, 200, 0) - would allow the resize handle to move to the left or right 100 pixels but not up or down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Boundary(0, -100, 0, 200) - would allow the resize handle to move to up or down 100 pixels but not left or right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Boundary(0,0,100,100) - would allow the list to expand in x or y 100 pixels but not grow smaller
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Boundary(-100,-100,100,100) - would allow the list to shrink in x or y 100 pixels but not grow bigger
resizeVisible - (default false) set to true to always see the resizeHandle - if resizeHandle is set to true
continuous - (default false) set to true to make the list scroll continuously - should have more elements than the viewNum for this
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
animateTo(index, timePerItem) - animate list to index at given time per item (default 50ms) - returns object for chaining
addAt(items, index, style, clone) - an array of items to insert at an index in the list - returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the list is made with no items to start and items are added with addAt() then set the List() viewNum parameter value to match roughly how many items will fit in view
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clone defaults to false - set to true to add a clone of the item or items to the list
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: does not support continuous at this time (whereas removeAt() does support continuous)
removeAt(number, index) - remove a number of elements (default 1) from the list starting at and including the index - returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: does support continuous (whereas addAt() does not support continuous)
clear() - clears the list
first() - select first list element - returns object to chain
last() - select last list element - returns object to chain
toggle(state, element) - for an accordion, will close the accordion if open or open if closed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passing in true will open (or keep opened), passing in false will close (or keep closed)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if no element is provided then it will assume the root (outer) element
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the element has no children then its parent element will be opened or closed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see toggled property (which only works on the root element)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note - in pulldown mode cannot call toggle() from change or tap methods - see pulldownToggle parameter instead
setCheck(index, type) - set the CheckBox at an index to true or false (the type parameter)
setChecks(type) - set all CheckBoxes to true or false (the type parameter) returns object for chaining
getCheck(index) - get the checked value of the CheckBox at an index
cancelCurrentDrag() - stop current drag on list - but add dragging back again for next drag
collapse(state) - state defaults to true to collapse or set to false to expand collapsed list
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must start with the collapse parameter set to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see collapsed property
openAtLevel(level) - open a level of an accordion list
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;level 0 shows first level, 1 shows second level, etc.
openAtId(idNum) - open an accordion list at a specific id number
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;view the tree property in the console (F12) and expand the data property to see ids
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then expand any ids to see more ids nested inside
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the idNum should be something like 6 or 12 without the word id.
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone() - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

COMPONENT LIST ITEMS
These static methods make special List items with components
See: https://zimjs.com/ten/pulldown.html
Each may have a label, min, max, starting val, steps, etc.
Each has a call parameter for the function to call when the component changes
There are alternatively obj and property parameters
Setting these will change the property of the obj to the value of the component

List.slider(label, min, max, val, call, step, obj, property, paddingLeft, paddingRight, factor, offset, backgroundColor)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A static method (use it like List.slider("fps", 0, 60, 20, doFps)) to make a slider List item
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;factor will multiply the slider value only in the stepper (at right)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offset will start the stepper offset by that amount
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this lets the stepper value be factored and offset from the actual slider value
List.checkBox(label, checked, call, obj, property, paddingLeft, paddingRight, backgroundColor)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A static method (use it like List.checkBox("visible", checked, doVisible)) to make a checkBox List item
List.colorPicker(label, color, picker, call, obj, property, paddingLeft, paddingRight, backgroundColor)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A static method (use it like List.colorPicker("color", red, docColor)) to make a colorPicker List item
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;picker is an optional custom ZIM ColorPicker

This static method is used internally by the checkBox parameter of List
It can be used to create a checkBox list element - but also see List.checkBox() above
which is a little different and matches the format of the other List Items
List.checkItem(text, width, paddingH, paddingV, color, rollColor, backgroundColor, rollBackgroundColor, selectedColor, selectedRollColor, selectedBackgroundColor, selectedRollBackgroundColor)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A static method (use it like List.checkItem("hello", 30, 300, 10, 10, white, etc.))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To add a checkItem to a plain list use:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new List({list:["goodbye", List.checkItem("hello", 30, 300, 10, 10, white), "what?"]})

inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone() - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

************************************
[31180] Selector(tile, borderColor, borderWidth, backgroundColor, corner, dashed, paddingH, paddingV, speed, diagonal, dim, multi, keyArrows, behind, resizeScale, selectedIndex, liveIndex, style, group, inherit);

Selector
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
A Selector acts on a ZIM Tile to provide an interactive selector that highlights a tile element.
The selector works as a select bar and a select pad.

See: https://zimjs.com/ten/wrapper.html which includes several Selector objects as bars
Selector as a pad would be similar to selecting letters on an onscreen TV remote system

Selector has a multi parameter that allows for multiple elements to be in selected mode.
The selectedIndex or selectedItem will only be the last selected.
And only one selecteIndex can be set at a time
but as many as desired can be set one after another - in a loop for instance.
The difference is that once selected, the item remains highlighted until unselected with a presseup.
This allows for a synth pad for instance where multiple notes can be played at the same time.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// the items in the Tile should be centerReg()
new Selector(new Tile(new Rectangle().centerReg(), 4, 4, 20, 20))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.change(e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.target.currentItem.alpha = 0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
S.update();

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
tile - (default four red circles) the ZIM Tile to which to apply the selector
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the elements should have their registration centered
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see Tile for how to tile a series of different objects, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will work as a horizontal or vertical bar or a grid selector
borderColor - (default white) the border color of the selector
borderWidth - (default 2) the border width of the selector
backgroundColor - (default "rgba(0,0,0,.1)") the background color of the selector
corner - (default 10) the corner radius of the selector
dashed - (default false) the dashed border setting of the selector
paddingH - (default half tile spacingH) the space from the selected item
paddingV - (default half tile spacingV) the background color of the selector
speed - (default 2) the speed the selector moves to the next selection - can set to 0 for instant
diagonal - (default false) defaults to animate horizontally and vertically - set to true for diagonally
dim - (default null) set to true for .7 alpha or a number between 0-1 for tile to dim while selector animates
multi - (default false) set to true to enable multiple highlights
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selectedIndex and selectedItem will still read only the last selected tile or set only one tile at a time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will need a multitouch devices - degrades fine to single touch if no multitouch
keyArrows - (default true) set to false to disable keyboard arrows
behind - (default false) set to true to put selector behind tile
resizeScale - (default false) set to true to resize the border as selector changes scale
selectedIndex - (default 0) the item index on which to start the selector - set to -1 for no selection
liveIndex - (default false) set to true to update the selectedIndex and dispatch a change event as selector animates across items
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone() - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
var dial = new Dial({step:1, backgroundColor:"violet"})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.change() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(dial.currentValue); // 1-10 in steps of 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
S.update();

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
min |ZIM VEE| - (default 0) the minimum value for the dial
max |ZIM VEE| - (default 10) the maximum value for the dial
step |ZIM VEE| - (default 1) 1 provides steps of 1, 0 is continuous decimal, 2 would provide steps of 2, etc.

innerTicks (default false) set to true to put the ticks inside if step is set
tickColor - (default backgroundColor) set the tick color if ticks are set
tickStep - (default step - or 1 if no step and useTicks is true) set to adjust tick amount
semiTicks - (default 0) add a number of semiTicks.  1 would add one smaller tick between ticks, 4 would add 4 smaller ticks, etc.
tickScale - (default 1) scale the height of the ticks
semiTickScale - (default 1) scale the height of the semiTicks
innerCircle - (default true) gives an inner knob look - set to false for flat

accentColor - (default zim.pink) color of filled part of accent
accentBackgroundColor - (default clear) color of background of accent
accentDifference - (default -.25) pixels accent background is bigger (or smaller if negative) than accentSize
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is used to stop bleeding of accent background
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but can also be used to make the accent half the width of the background so it runs in a track, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or fatter than the background so it runs on a wire or mono-rail
sound - (default false) - set to true to rotate dial -180 and set a gap of .25
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adjusts various defaults for ticks, accent, indicatorType, etc.
linear - (default false - unless sound is true) - set to true to pressdrag up and down to increase and decrease dial
gap - (default 0) ratio of circle 360 to leave as a gap between dial start and dial end
limit - (default true) stops dial from spinning right around - set to false to not limit dial
keyArrows - (default true) set to false to disable keyboard arrows
keyArrowsStep - (default 1% of max-min) number to increase or decrease value when arrow is used
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if step is set, then this value is ignored and set to step
keyArrowsH - (default true) use left and right arrows when keyArrows is true
keyArrowsV - (default true) use up and down arrows when keyArrows is true
continuous - (default false) this turns the dial into a continuous dial from the min at the top
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The (max-min)/360 give a delta value per degree
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and as the dial goes clockwise it adds the delta and as it goes counterclockwise it subtracts the delta
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steps are still used or not if set to zero

continuousMax - (default null) set to Number to limit the maximum total value of the dial when continuous is true
damp - (default null) set to value such as .1 to damp the slider currentValue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IGNORED when limit set to false - otherwise may damp incorrectly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use with Ticker rather than "change" event - eg:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ticker.add(function () {circle.x = slider.currentValue;});
currentValue |ZIM VEE| - (default min value) - set the currentValue at start
useLabels - (default false) - add Labels to ticks if useTicks is true - can apply STYLE
labelMargin - (default 10) - distance from ticks to Label if useLabels is true
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults

Tabs
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
A traditional tab layout for along the edge of content.
Can also act as an independent button row or column.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
var tabs = new Tabs({tabs:["A", "B", "C", "D"], spacing:5, corner:14})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.change(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(tabs.selectedIndex);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(tabs.text);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
S.update();

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
width - (default 240) overall width of tab set (ZIM divides the width across tabs and spacing)
height - (default 60) height of tabs
tabs - (default ["1","2","3","4"]) an array of any String, Number, Label, Button, (or any DisplayObject)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR tab objects with the following properties available:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any tab specific properties will override the default values from other parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[{label:"String", width:200, backgroundColor:red, rollBackgroundColor:pink, downBackgroundColor:purple, selectedBackgroundColor:grey, color:yellow, selectedColor:"lime", downColor:white}, {etc.}]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;label can be a String or a Label object - default text color is white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tab objects can also include wait properties for individual buttons.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(this was put in place before Buttons were allowed in the tabs array - so you can just add a Button to the tab array instead)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See wait, waitTime, waitBackgroundColor, rollWaitBackgroundColor, waitColor, rollWaitColor, waitModal and waitEnabled parameters below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wait can be used with button's waiting property to offer an alternative to a loading screen or confirmation panel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see the button's clearWait() method to cancel the wait state and waited event that triggers when the wait is done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wait will primarily be applicable when the tabs are used as a set of buttons rather than traditional tabbing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warning - do not use the same array for multiple tabs as the array is turned into an array of objects used by the Tabs object.
backgroundColor - (default tin) the background color of a deselected tab when not rolled over
rollBackgroundColor - (default grey) the rollover background color
downBackgroundColor - (default null) the pressing down background color
selectedBackgroundColor - (default dark) the background color of the selected tab (any CSS color)
selectedRollBackgroundColor - (default rollBackgroundColor) the background color of the selected tab on rollover (if currentEnabled is true)

selectedColor - (default color) the text color of the selected tab (any CSS color)
selectedRollColor - (default rollColor) the text color of the selected tab on rollover (if currentEnabled is true)
vertical - (default false) set to true to make vertical tabs with text still horizontal
spacing - (default 1) is the pixels between tab buttons
currentEnabled - (default false) set to true to be able to press (a second time) the selected tab button
currentSelected - (default true) set to false to not highlight the current button (good for button bars)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting this to true will set currentEnabled to true
corner - (default 0) the corner radius of the tabs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can also be an array of [topLeft, topRight, bottomRight, bottomLeft]
base - (default "none") specifiy a side for flat bottom when corner is set (but not set to an array)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other values are "bottom" (default when corner and not vertical), LEFT (default when corner and vertical), TOP, RIGHT
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** this was flatBottom - but then vertical tabs were added so it was changed in ZIM 9.2.0
keyEnabled - (default true) so tab key cycles through tabs, shift tab backwards
gradient - (default null) 0 to 1 (try .3) adds a gradient to the tabs
gloss - (default null) 0 to 1 (try .1) adds a gloss to the tabs
wait - (default null) String text for tab to say when pressed to enter a wait mode

align - (default CENTER) horizontal align
valign - (default CENTER) vertical align
labelAlign - (default CENTER) horizontal align of the label only
labelValign - (default CENTER) vertical align of the label only
labelIndent - (default indent) indent of label when align or valign is set - usually same as indent unless custom objects are in tabs
labelIndentH - (default indent) horizontal indent of label when align or valign is set
labelIndentV - (default indent) vertical indent of label when align or valign is set
indent - (default 10) indent of items when align or valign is set and there are custom objects in tabs
useTap - (default false) set to true to use tap to activate otherwise uses ACTIONEVENT (mousedown or click)
excludeCustomTap - (default false) set to true to exclude custom buttons from tap() which would override existing tap() on the buttons

ColorPicker
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
A traditional color picker which shows 256 Web colors by default or custom colors.
Can additionally show 16 greys and / or an alpha slider.
Picking on a color sets the swatch color and the selectedColor property.
OK dispatches a "change" event if the color changed or a close event if not.
The X dispatches a "close" event.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const cp = new ColorPicker()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.show() // use show() and hide() with ColorPicker. As of ZIM ZIM 01 can also use pos(), loc(), center(), etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.change(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(cp.selectedColor); // #ffcc99, etc. after pressing OK
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(cp.selectedAlpha); // 0-1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
width - (default 500) the width of the color picker
colors - (default "spectrum") - this shows a color spectrum, drag bar with collapse, mode and close (if no buttonBar)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these can be configured with ColorPicker parameters (see spectrum parameter near end of parameters).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mode toggles between a gradient and pixel blocks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the colors to "legacy" to show the traditional 256 colors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or pass in an optional list of colors ["red", "#CCC", etc.]
cols - (default 10) how many columns to use if you pass in custom colors
spacing - (default 2) is the space between the color squares
greyPicker - (default true unless one row) shows an extra 16 greys (set to false to hide these)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the default colors it also includes 2 starting colors that record last picked colors
alphaPicker - (default true unless one row) shows an alpha slider (set to false to hide this)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the swatch has a black, grey and white backing underneath to show multiple alpha effects
startBackgroundColor - (default the last color in color array) the starting color
draggable - (default true (false if no buttonBar or no spectrum)) whether you can drag the component - set to false to not drag
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a small grip under the color text shows if draggable
shadowColor - (default rgba(0,0,0,.3)) set to -1 for no drop shadow
shadowBlur - (default 14) the blur of the shadow if shadow is set
buttonBar - (default true unless one row) set to false to hide the button bar with OK and X (close)
circles - (default false) set to true to show colors in circles rather than squares
indicator - (default true) set to false to remove indicator from currentBackgroundColor
backgroundColor - (default black) the color of the background
keyArrows - (default true) set to false to disable keyboard arrows
container - (default zimDefaultFrame) if using show(), hide(), toggle() can set which container to center on
selectedIndex - (default 0) - set the selectedIndex at start
dropperTarget - (default null) - set to a DisplayObject to use dropper on the target - such as the stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dropper will always work on the spectrum
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dropperTarget will cache the target so a color can be picked from it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but this is modal on the target so buttons, etc. cannot be used and animations will not be seen
spectrumCollapse - (default true) - if spectrum color is set, set to false to not show a collapse button
spectrumMode - (default true) - if spectrum color is set, set to false to not show a mode button
spectrumClose - (default true) - if spectrum color is set, set to false to not show a close button
spectrumOk - (default true) - if spectrum color is set and there is a buttonBar, set to false to not show an OK button
spectrumTitle - (default null) - if spectrum color then this is the title - for example, set to "Color Picker"
collapsed - (default false) - if spectrum and spectrumCollapse then set to true to start collapsed
tolerancePicker - (default false) - show a slider for tolerance - useful for when using ColorPicker to keyOut a color
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: this will automatically hide the alphaPicker
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
show() - show the picker (returns the picker for chaining) (as of ZIM ZIM 01 can also use pos(), loc(), center(), etc.)
hide() - hides the picker (as of ZIM ZIM 01 can also use removeFrom())
toggle(state - default null) - shows if hidden and hides if showing (returns the picker for chaining)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or pass in true to show picker or false to hide picker
toggleSpectrum(state - default null) - if run without state will toggle the spectrum mode
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or pass in true to show gradient or false to show pixel blocks
collapse(state - default true) - with the "spectrum" setting, set state to true (default) to collapse or false to expand the picker
updateDropperTarget() - with the "spectrum" setting, a cached view of the dropperTarger is shown to pick the color from
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;using updateDropperTarget() will update this cached view - it is processor intensive so beware
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone() - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can be overridden with the x and y parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the TextEditor will show on the stage of the Label
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the label is not on the stage then the stage of the frame parameter otherwise the stage of the ZIMDefaultFrame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the editor is already open it will not move
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling show(label2) on a different label will switch the editor to that label
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see also the label property
hide() - hides the editor
closeColorPicker() - close the ColorPicker - this needs to display the text (which is hidden when the ColorPicker opens)
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone() - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: see all the methods of the ZIM Panel

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:
on(), off(), getBounds(), setBounds(), cache(), uncache(), updateCache(), dispatchEvent(),
addChild(), removeChild(), addChildAt(), getChildAt(), contains(), removeAllChildren(), etc.

************************************
[36586] Keyboard(labels, backgroundColor, color, shiftBackgroundColor, shiftHoldBackgroundColor, placeBackgroundColor, placeColor, cursorColor, shadeAlpha, borderColor, borderWidth, margin, corner, draggable, placeClose, shadowColor, shadowBlur, container, data, place, placeShiftH, placeShiftV, special, rtl, hardKeyboard, layout, numPadScale, numPadDraggable, numPadOnly, numPadAdvanced, style, group, inherit)

Keyboard
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
The Keyboard class makes a keyboard ideal for mobile or touch screens.
Often, it seems the mobile keyboard can cause problems with layout.
This in-canvas keyboard requires much less testing and concern.
The Keyboard can work with ZIM Labels to give input text without a TextArea.
Thanks Frank Los for the initial design and coding of the Keyboard.
Keyboard also captures hard keyboard keydown and will type that as well
See https://zimjs.com/keyboard

NOTE: press and hold down the vowels for multiple vowel options
NOTE: multi-line Label and TextArea input is not supported
NOTE: the width of the Label can be set by the Label's lineWidth paremeter
NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// create Labels to capture the text from the keyboard
const text1 = new Label({text:"", backgroundColor:white}).pos(100,100);
const text2 = new Label({text:"", backgroundColor:white}).pos(100,200);

// create a new Keyboard and pass in the labels as an array
// or if just one label, then pass in the label
const keyboard = new Keyboard([text1, text2]);

// if just the letter is needed use the keydown event
keyboard.on("keydown", e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(e.letter);
});

// create events to capture a mousedown on the labels
const text1Event = text1.on("mousedown", activate);
const text2Event = text2.on("mousedown", activate);
function activate(e) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keyboard.show();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// remove the events when keyboard is active
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text1.off("mousedown", text1Event);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text2.off("mousedown", text2Event);
}
keyboard.show(); // optionally show the keyboard to start

// add back the events to show the keyboard
keyboard.on("close", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text1.on("mousedown", text1Event);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text2.on("mousedown", text2Event);
});

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
labels - (default null) a ZIM Label to show letters in or an array of labels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keyboard will add a cursor to the Labels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and provide management across multiple labels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;currently, multiline labels are not supported
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting the label lineWidth will set the max width of the label
backgroundColor - (default dark) an css color for the background color of the keys
color - (default white) the color of the text
shiftBackgroundColor - (default "orange") the color of the active shift key
shiftHoldBackgroundColor - (default "red") the color of the active shift hold key

shadeAlpha - (default .2) special keys are shaded darker by this alpha
margin - (default 5) the margin around the keyboard from the container width
corner - (default 30) the round of the corner (set to 0 for no corner)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can also be an array of [topLeft, topRight, bottomRight, bottomLeft]
draggable - (default false) set to true to show the drag handle at top right
placeClose - (default true) shows an x key to close the cursor placement menu

data - (default see below) pass in data for the letters on the three sets of keyboards
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see the layout parameter for current default layouts like "arabic", "hebrew", etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below is the default data - change any of the keys to change keyboard
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be three boards (you can request more)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be a button specified on the fourth row to toggle to the second screen and back
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be a button on the second and third screen at the start of the third row
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to toggle between the second and third screen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "shift" and "delete" keys are optional and can be moved or removed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a "back" key that is like the "backspace" key but takes the space of one key and not two keys
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be at least 10 key places but there can be more than 10 keys per row
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last element of the outer array is a an object with special characters for e,u,i,o,a,n
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If left off then it will use the characters below in the example.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These can be changed to any characters showing an extra set of any characters.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth and sixth elements are lowercase to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase override mappings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, in the turkish layout ı:"I" and i:"İ" for lowercase to uppercase
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I:"ı" and İ:"i" for uppercase to lowercase.

Organizer
zim class - extends a zim.Tabs which extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
A Tabs bar of interface for organizing a ZIM List.
This includes add, up, down, toTop, toBottom and remove icon buttons.
The Organizer can sit above the list and allow the user to add, remove and reorder the list.
Adding an item will add an empty button - this would need to be filled with the user input, etc.
If the user input is not ready, the autoAdd parameter can be set to false.
The change event will report an orgType of "add" and the add() method can be used when the input is ready.
The same for positioning or removing if desired.

[38441] Connectors(width, height, points, node, line, linear, linearWrap, linearOrder, num, snapH, snapV, dropType, dropArray, continuous, startIndex, duplicateLine, deleteNode, dblclick, fullMove, min, max, boundary, expand, nodeRollColor, nodeRollBorderColor, nodeSelectedColor, nodeSelectedBorderColor, baseColor, baseBorderColor, baseRollover, rootLock, grandChildren, dblclickTime, steps, style, group, inherit)

Connectors
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Adds nodes (any DisplayObject - default a Circle) that can be dragged to draw a connector line.
There are three main uses for Connectors:

1. Connecting dots like in coloring books - use linear:true
2. Making hieararchy type drawings - use snaps
3. Connecting objects like boxes together - pass in objects to the points

The num parameter limits the number of lines that can be drawn from a node.
The dropType can be set to require nodes to be dropped on or off other nodes (or the default, any).
There are min and max distances the connections can be made.
These and the other parameters provide a variety of game and puzzle options.

The Line can be set to have start and end heads.
The lineType in the Line can be set to "straight", "corner" or "curve"
Line also accepts points for any arrangement of a connector
but in this version, these have not been used in Connectors.

See: https://zimjs.com/cat/connectors.html

PREMADE CONNECTIONS
As of ZIM ZIM 02, Connectors() have a steps property that represents connections made.
Use getSteps(true) when done making connections - this will popup an array of steps.
Copy this array of steps to the steps parameter of the Connector() in the app code.
Connectors will then be made and the additional steps added.
Connectors can also be added to a ZIM TransformManager() so users can easily recreated their connections.

See https://zimjs.com/zim/connectors.html

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// draws four general connectors that can be connected to one another in a box
// adjust connector nodes after connections are complete
const connectors = new Connectors({linear:true}).center();
connectors.on("complete", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connectors.nodes.loop(node=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;node.radius = 5;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// or hide connectors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// connectors.nodes.alp(0);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

EXAMPLE
// make a grid of connectors and only connect to other nodes
// do not let user delete a node or doubleclick to move a node
const points = [];
const spacing = 60;
loop(10, i=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loop(10, j=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;points.push([i*spacing, j*spacing]);

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Blob or Squiggle do not need to be added to the stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use the getPoints(true) method of the Blob or Squiggle or see https://zimjs.com/paths/
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or can specify an array of a base (that connectors nodes will be added to) and baseInfo as follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[[base, baseInfo], [base, baseInfo], [base, baseInfo], etc.]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the baseInfo can be a number of nodes to place around all base sides
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or baseInfo can be an array with three different formats:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[all]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[left/right, top/bottom]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[left, right, top, bottom]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These can be numbers greater than 0 for the number of nodes on the side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or 0 for no nodes on the side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or -1 for both corners on the side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or -2 for the first corner on the side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or -3 for the second corner on the side
node - (default new Circle(10, grey, grey)) the DisplayObject to use as a node - should be centerReg()
line - (default new zim.Line({thickness:3, color:tin, strokeObj:{caps:"round"}})) the line to use as the connector
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZIM Line has a lineType parameter for "straight", "corner", and "curve" which will affect the connector lines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZIM Line has a lineOrientation parameter of AUTO, HORIZONTAL or VERTICAL that will affect the connector lines
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZIM Line as curveH and curveV settings that will adjust the lines for the "curve" setting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the caps should be set to "round" if drawing with clear or transparent nodes
linear - (default false) lines will only connect to points that are next to one another (in the point order)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is good for connecting dots
linearWrap - (default true) let the first point connect to the last point in the linear setting
linearOrder - (default false) require the points to be connected in order
num - (default null) set the maximum number of lines that can come from a node
snapH - (default null) snap the nodes to a provided horizontal distance
snapV - (default null) snap the nodes to a provided vertical distance
dropType - (default "any") determines what happens when a node is dropped as follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"any" lets the node be dropped anywhere (and may be snapped)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"on" will save the node if dropped on an existing node otherwise it is removed or put back to where it is dragged from
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"off" will save the node if not dropped on an existing node otherwise it is removed or put back to where it is dragged from
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"single" will save the node if dropped on a node with no existing connections otherwise it is removed or put back to where it is dragged from
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note - these only work with the currently dragged node - not other multiple selected nodes
dropArray - (defult null) with "on" or "single" dropType and NOT linear - specify which nodes a node can be connected to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use an array of arrays for each point index [[indexes], [indexes], etc]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. [[1,2],[0,2],[3],[0,1]] - if in "on", point 0 can go to 1 or 2, point 1 can go to point 0 or 2, point 2 can only go to 3, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if "single" is set then only one line can be drawn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see dropIndex and dropArray for each node and the targetNode property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each time a connection is made, a new node is created - these will inherit the dropIndex and dropArray from a targetNode
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and if the latestNode's dropArray and its lineArray are the same and the duplicateLines is false then a "blocked" event is dispatched
continuous - (default false) set to true to force nodes to only be made from the last node
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all other nodes will have their noMouse() set - also see startIndex - also see linear for doing points in order
startIndex - (default null) set to a point index to force connectors to start at that node
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all other nodes will have there noMouse() set - also see continous
duplicateLines - (default true) set to false to not allow multiple lines between the same connectors
deleteNode - (default true) set to false to not allow nodes to be deleted by holding or doubleclicking and delete key
dblclick - (default true) set to false to not allow nodes to be selected by doubleclicking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selected nodes can be moved together
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selecting a node selects its children unless the ctrl key is held at which point it will not select children
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;selected nodes can be deleted with the delete key (or hold to delete)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deleting a node will delete its children
fullMove - (default true) set to false to not automatically drag a node when it is full (if num is set)
min - (default node radius or smallest dimension) the minimum distance from the node's parent a node must move before placing node
max - (default null) the maximum distance from the node's parent a node can be moved to be placed
boundary - (default null) a ZIM Boundary object for the nodes - or a DisplayObject such as the stage (see ZIM Drag)
expand - (default 0 or 10 on mobile) expand the node mousedown area
nodeRollColor - (default node.color.lighten(.2)) the color of the node as rolled over
nodeRollBorderColor - (default node.borderColor) the borderColor of the node as rolled over
nodeSelectedColor - (default white) the selected node color if doubleclicked
nodeSelectedBorderColor - (default node.borderColor) the selected node borderColor if doubleclicked
baseColor - (default node.color) the color of the node connected to a base DisplayObject (see points parameter)
baseBorderColor - (default node.borderColor) the borderColor of the node connected to a base DisplayObject (see points parameter)
baseRollover - (default false) set to true to change all nodes on a base to their roll colors when rolling over the base
rootLock - (default false) do not let the root node (a node in the points array) be draggable or deletable
grandChildren - (default true) do not let there be grandchildren - so there can only be the root nodes and their direct children
dblclickTime - (default .5) time in seconds to capture a double click within (also see ZIM TIME constant)
steps - (default null) pass in an array of [nodeNum, dropX, dropY] arrays to recreate the steps - see getSteps(), setSteps() and steps property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can be used to recreate a previously made set of connectors and connections
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: the steps may also include a delete flag, and moveX and moveY values and a flag for single select (rather than default children select)
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
addNode(x, y, base) - add a node at x and y (and on a base)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot add nodes in linear mode - see linear parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;addNode will not work with the dropArray parameter
removeNode(node) - remove the node (and its children)
removeConnectors() - removes all nodes and connectors except for root nodes which were specified in the points parameter
selectNode(node, children) - select a node and its children unless children parameter is set to false
makeConnection(node, x, y) - add a connection from a node to an x and y position
getSteps(popup) - gets an array of [nodeNum, dropX, dropY] that are automatically recorded each connection.  Also see the steps property.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can then copeied and passed into the steps parameter of Connectors() or the setSteps() method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to recreate recorded connections allowing a set of connectors to be recreated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: the steps may also include a delete flag, and moveX and moveY values and a flag for single select (rather than default children select).
setSteps(steps) - add steps to a Connectors() object - or use the steps parameter - also applySteps() for backwards compatibility
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;steps of [nodeNum, dropX, dropY] are automatically collected when nodes are made and stored in a steps array.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data for the steps can be collected with getSteps(popup) and shown in a popup window if desired.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then pass the steps in to the Connectors() step parameter or use setSteps(steps) to recreate the recorded Connectors.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: the steps may also include a delete flag, and moveX and moveY values and a flag for single select (rather than default children select).
addBase(base, baseInfo) - add nodes to a base DisplayObject - see the points parameter for info about the baseInfo
removeBase(base) - remove the connectors for a base - the base will still need to be removed with removeFrom()
setAvailableIndexes(indexes) - set the provided index or array of indexes to be active
clone() - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.

[40126] Carousel(items, viewNum, time, spacing, backgroundColor, backing, padding, paddingH, paddingV, arrowLeft, arrowRight, arrowGap, valign, ease, swipe, remember, selectedIndex, continuous, style, group, inherit)

Carousel
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
A horizontal display for multiple objects with arrows at sides to animate to previous and next.
This is good for sliding banners, or sliding through a set of icons.
Items will be tiled in a ZIM Tile with one row.
It is expected that the items be the same width and height
but if not, the items will have width set to the most common width and heights aligned vertically to the valign setting.
Thank you Marva for the idea and original code!

See: ZIM Marquee for a more complex alternate format with Indicator
See: https://zimjs.com/zim/carousel.html for an example

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const items = [
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Rectangle(400,80,red).tap(()=&gt;{zog("red");}),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Rectangle(400,80,green).tap(()=&gt;{zog("green");}),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Rectangle(400,80,blue).tap(()=&gt;{zgo("https://zimjs.com","_blank");})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;];
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Carousel(items, 1).center();

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
items - default(seven multicolored rectangles) an array of Display Objects - can be interactive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;items will be scaled to the most common width and tiled - see the tile property&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a String item will be converted to a new Pic(item)
viewNum - default(3) the number of items to show
time - default(.2) time in seconds to animate between items (also see ZIM TIME constant)
spacing - default(20) the space between the items
backgroundColor - default(clear) the backgroundColor - also see background property
backing - default(null) - an optional backing DisplayObject that goes on top of the backing and under the tile
padding - default(0) - the default for the background outside the tile
paddingH - default(padding) - the horizontal padding to override the padding setting
paddingV - default(padding) - the vertical padding to override the padding setting

arrowRight - default(new Arrow()) - an arrow for going right
arrowGap - default(20) the gap between the arrow and the backing
valign - default(CENTER) the vertical alignment of the tile items
ease - default(quadInOut) the ease of the animation - see ZIM animate() ease parameter for types
swipe - default(true) set to false to not make the tile swipeable - see also the swipe property
remember - default("zimCarousel") set to false to not remember the selectedIndex when reloading the page
selectedIndex - default(0 or remembered index) the starting index - see also the selectedIndex property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is the index of the first (left) item in view
continuous - default(true) set to false to stop at ends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will clone the items and use the modulus to keep index numbers correct
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if continuous is false and the carousel is cycled then it will bounce back and forth
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
goRight(time) - go to the right - time defaults to Carousel time parameter but can be customized - returns object for chaining
goLeft(time) - go to the left - time defaults to Carousel time parameter but can be customized - returns object for chaining
cycle(cycleTime, transitionTime, repeat, repeatNum, recycle, rtl) |ZIM VEE| - cycle the carousel from the current selectedIndex (see also remember)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cycleTime (default 5) in seconds to animate to next item
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transitionTime (default 1) in seconds to animate between items - overrides Carousel time setting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;often a faster Carousel time is desired for pressing arrows or swiping
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a slower transitionTime when cycling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat (default true) continue past ends if carousel continuous is set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or go back and forth from start to end if continuous is not set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to false to just go one once
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeatNum (default 0) set to a number greater than 0 to limit repeats or bounces - returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for bounce, use .5 for partial cycle for example, 1.5 will go forth then back then forth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recycle (default cycleTime*2) time in seconds to restart cycle if cleared due to arrows or swipes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to false or -1 to not restart the cycle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rtl (default DIR) if true will stop going back to 0 selectedIndex if no repeat
cycleClear() - stops the cycle
disableArrows() - turn arrows off - returns object for chaining
enableArrows() - turn arrows on - returns object for chaining
clone() - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

************************************
[40613] Loader(width, height, label, type, backgroundColor, rollBackgroundColor, color, rollColor, borderColor, borderWidth, corner, shadowColor, shadowBlur, hitPadding, gradient, gloss, dashed, backing, rollBacking, rollPersist, icon, rollIcon, toggle, toggleBacking, rollToggleBacking, toggleIcon, rollToggleIcon, toggleEvent, frame, multiple, accept, style, group, inherit)

Loader
zim class - extends a zim.Button which extends a zim.Container

DESCRIPTION
Loader lets you upload images, text or JSON.  These are available on the loaded event function.
Loader uses the HTML input type=file tag and overlays this with a createjs DOMElement.
Loader is a Button so can be displayed for the user to click on.
It defaults to a dashed line region as you can also drag and drop files to the loader.
You can also save an image using the save() method to a new browser window for the user to save

NOTE: due to the HTML tag being overlayed, the loader.resize() must be called if it is moved
(This is called automatically when the stage is resized)

NOTE: if the loader is placed in a container and the container is removed or added again
the loader must be manually removed or added again with loader.removeFrom() or loader.addTo().
This is so ZIM does not have to keep track of HTML tags each time a container is added or removed.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const loader = new Loader({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frame:frame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;label:"UPLOAD PIC OR DROP PICS HERE",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width:700,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height:400,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corner:50
}).center();
loader.on("loaded", e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loop(e.bitmaps, bitmap=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bitmap.centerReg().drag();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loader.removeFrom(stage);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

// and to later save for instance in a button event:
saveButton.on("click") {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loader.save(stage); // or some other container... can specify crop bounds too
}

EXAMPLE
// loading a JSON file:
const loader = new Loader({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frame:frame,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type:"JSON",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;label:"UPLOAD JSON",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;width:700,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height:400,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corner:50
}).center();
// choose a test.json file with the following in it:
// {"test":"testing"}
loader.on("loaded", e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(e.json.test); // "testing"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loader.removeFrom();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

METHODS
resize() - call the resize event if the scale or position of the Loader is changed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will sync the location of the HTML input tag
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resize() is only needed if the scale or x, y of the Loader (or its container) is changed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is not needed for general window resizing - the Loader handles this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: if the Frame itself changes location in the HTML document, call a F.update()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will then dispatch an update event to the Loader and it will resize()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is not needed if resizing the window or scrolling - see Frame update() method docs
save(content, filename, x, y, width, height, cached, cachedBounds, type, data, quality) - save a picture (supports ZIM DUO)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;content - the Display object to be saved such as a Container, Bitmap, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filename - (default random) - the text name of the file (with or without extension - also see type)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x, y, width, height - the cropping bounds on that object otherwise defaults to 0,0,W,H
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cached - (default false) set to true if the object is currently already cached
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cachedBounds - if you are saving a different bounds than was previously cached
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting the bounds here (createjs.Rectangle) will restore the cache to the previous bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type - (default "png") set to "jpeg" for jpeg
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data - (default false) set to true to save as base64 data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise save returns the object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quality - (default .92) a number between 0 an 1 representing the quality of the saved image (jpeg)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note, this parameter may be moved to before data in the next version of ZIM

Button methods:
setBacking(type, newBacking) - dynamically set any type of backing for button (if null removes backing for that type)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backing types are: "backing", "rollBacking", "toggleBacking", "rollToggleBacking", "waitBacking", "rollWaitBacking"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note - all backing will have a pattern property if a pattern is set as a backing
setIcon(type, newIcon) - dynamically set any type of icon for button (if null removes icon for that type)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Icon types are: "icon", "rollIcon", "toggleIcon", "rollToggleIcon", "waitIcon", "rollWaitIcon"
toggle(state) - forces a toggle of label if toggle param is string, else toggles icon if icon is set or otherwise toggles backing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;state defaults to null so just toggles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass in true to go to the toggled state and false to go to the original state
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone() - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.

************************************
[41219] TextArea(width, height, placeholder, text, size, padding, color, backgroundColor, borderColor, borderWidth, corner, shadowColor, shadowBlur, dashed, id, readOnly, spellCheck, password, inputType, wrap, maxLength, frame, expand, keyboardShift, style, group, inherit)

TextArea
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
TextArea creates an input text field by overlaying an HTML TextArea.
The TextArea is then overlayed with the createjs DOMElement
and scaled and positioned with ZIM code. This can also be used if selectable text is required
Access to the HTML tag is provided with the TextArea tag property.
So CSS Styles can be applied to the HTML tag as with any HTML textarea tag
The TextArea comes with a ZIM Rectangle in behind that you can adjust with parameters
or remove completely if you so desire using the TextArea background property
ie. myTextArea.background.alpha=0; or myTextArea.removeChild(myTextArea.background)

NOTE: due to the HTML tag being overlayed, the TextArea.resize() must be called if it is moved
(This is called automatically when the stage is resized)
It also means that a TextArea in a Window or List is probably not a good thing.
Consider using Label and then toggling a TextArea on mouseover and mouseout.
See https://zimjs.com/snips for an older discontinued example.

NOTE: if the TextArea is placed in a container and the container is removed or added again
the textArea must be manually removed or added again with textArea.removeFrom() or textArea.addTo().
This is so ZIM does not have to keep track of HTML tags each time a container is added or removed.
When using TextArea in a Pane or in Pages this will be automatically handled
only if the TextArea is directly in the Pane or the page (not nested in further Containers)

NOTE: rotation and skewing of TextArea is not supported - although might work with custom CSS transformations

NOTE: because of these limitations, consider the TextEditor as a solution.
The TextEditor allows you to use a Label which is a proper part of the Canvas
and then change the label with a pop-up editor that includes a TextArea.
SEE: https://zimjs.com/cat/texteditor.html

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const textArea = new TextArea(300, 200).center();

const label = new Label({text:""}).pos(20,20);
textArea.on("input", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;label.text = textArea.text;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

// to set scrollBars on TextArea use CSS on the TextArea tag property:
textArea.tag.style.overflow = "auto"; // etc.

// if manually scaled or positioned (or container is scaled or positioned)
// then the TextArea must be resized with the resize method
textArea.sca(.5).mov(200);
textArea.resize();

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
width - (default 250) the width of the TextArea backing (the textarea field will be that less the padding*2)
height - (default 70) the height of the TextArea backing (the textarea field will be that less the padding*2)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: to set scrollBars use CSS: textArea.tag.style.overflow = "auto";
placeholder - (default null) the HTML placeholder for the TextArea
text - (default null) the text of the TextArea - see also the text property
size - (default 20) a Number for the font-size of the TextArea (do not use px on the end)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to change the font, use CSS on the tag property: textArea.tag.style.fontFamily = "courier";
padding - (default 5) the pixels between the backing border and the HTML textarea
color - (default granite) text color (any CSS color)
backgroundColor - (default "rgba(256,256,256,.1)") background color of box
borderColor - (default rgba(0,0,0,.1)) the color of the border
borderWidth - (default 1) thickness of the border
corner - (default 0) the round of the corner (set to 0 for no corner)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can also be an array of [topLeft, topRight, bottomRight, bottomLeft]
shadowColor - (default null) the shadow color (css color) of a drop shadow
shadowBlur - (default null) pixels of how blurred the shadow is if the shadow is set - eg. 10
dashed - (default true) set to false to turn off the dashed for the border
id - (default null) a string id for the HTML textarea tag for CSS styling, etc.
placeholder - (default null) a string that is used for the HTML textarea tag placeholder parameter
readOnly - (default false) set to true to make TextArea read only (still selectable)
spellCheck - (default true) set to false to turn Browser spell check off
password - (default false) set to true to turn the field into a password field - single line only (uses input field type=password and not TextArea)
inputType - (default false) set to "text" to show a text input (one line) - or try other HTML input types - "email", "number", etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the various types of HTML inputs are not really tested - would suggest using Tag() instead for these (or preferably ZIM components)
wrap - (default true) set to false to stop the textarea from wrapping (css white-space:pre)
maxLength - (default null) set to a number to limit the number of characters in the textarea
frame - (default the zdf) a reference to the Frame (to scale and position the HTML tag)
expand - (default 20) hit area around background to count as a press on TextArea - handy for dragging as HTML tag area will override mouse on canvas
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
setFocus(type) - sets the focus of the TextArea tag (thanks Armin for the prompting)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type is a Boolean that defaults to true - set to false to make the TextArea blur (loose focus)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might need timeout 100ms before setting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see also focus property
resize() - call the resize method if the scale or position of the TextArea is changed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will sync the location of the HTML textarea tag
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resize() is only needed if the scale or x, y of the TextArea (or its container) is changed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is not needed for general window resizing - the TextArea handles this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: if the Frame itself changes location in the HTML document, call a F.update()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will then dispatch an update event to the TextArea and it will resize()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is not needed if resizing the window or scrolling - see Frame update() method docs
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone() - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:
on(), off(), getBounds(), setBounds(), cache(), uncache(), updateCache(), dispatchEvent(),

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
currentValue - get or set the text content of the TextArea
text - get or set the text value
focus - get or set if the TextArea tag has focus or use setFocus() to set (might need timeout 100ms before setting)
readOnly - set to true to not be able to edit or to false to be able to edit (always can select)
maxLength - get or set the maximum number of characters typed - will not truncate existing characters until typed
tag - the HTML textarea tag - just a regular HMTL form tag which can be styled
background - access to the Rectangle() used for the background
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can remove this with yourTextArea.background.removeFrom(yourTextArea);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or adjust it dynamically with any of the Rectangle properties like color
blendMode - how the object blends with what is underneath - such as "difference", "multiply", etc. same as CreateJS compositeOperation
keyFocus - get or set the keyboard focus on the component - see also zim.KEYFOCUS
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be set to true if this component is the first made or component is the last to be used

************************************
[41665] Tag(width, height, id, frame, backgroundColor, padding, paddingH, paddingV, expand, style, group, inherit)

Tag
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Creates a &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; with id of id and overlays it on the Canvas with the createjs DOMElement
The tag is scaled and positioned with ZIM code and can be filled with any HTML desired
Access to the HTML tag is provided with the tag property (so you can use innerHTML or style on this)
However a convenience innerHTML and style properties have been added to Tag
CSS Styles can be applied to the HTML tag as with any HTML div tag
Or use the chainable add() method to add a String of HTML (instead of setting innerHTML)

SEE: https://zimjs.com/explore/tag.html

NOTE: due to the HTML tag being overlayed, the tag.resize() must be called if it is manually scaled or moved
(This is called automatically when the stage is resized)

NOTE: if the tag is placed in a container and the container is removed or added again
the tag must be manually removed or added again with tag.removeFrom() or tag.addTo().
This is so ZIM does not have to keep track of HTML tags each time a container is added or removed.

NOTE: rotation and skewing of Tag is not supported - although might work with custom CSS transformations

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const tag = new Tag(300, 60).center().add("&lt;h1&gt;TITLE TEXT&lt;/h1&gt;");
tag.style.color = red;

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)

paddingH - (default padding) inner horizontal padding between edge of background rectangle and HTML tag
paddingV - (default padding) inner vertical padding between edge of background rectangle and HTML tag
expand - (default 20) hit area around background to count as a press on Tag - handy for dragging as HTML tag area will override mouse on canvas
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
add(htmlString) - chainable method to add HTML to tag - calling add() again will append
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see innerHTML property as alternative or to overwrite the innerHTML
resize(update) - call the resize event if the scale or position of the tag is changed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will sync the location of the div tag
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resize() is only needed if the scale or x, y of the tag (or its container) is changed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is not needed for general window resizing - the Tag handles this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: if the Frame itself changes location in the HTML document, call a F.update()

************************************
[41952] obj.cache(width||x, height||y, null||width, null||height, scale, options, margin)

cache
zim DisplayObject method overrides CreateJS cache() method with more flexible parameters
https://createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/Container.html#method_cache

DESCRIPTION
Turns the object into a bitmap which can be rendered more efficiently, especially on mobile.
Caching may blur the object slightly, most noticable when caching a Label.
Every stage update must re-render objects on the stage.
This can be processor intensive for lots of vectors - such as Labels and Shapes.
Generally, we can build without caching but if better performance is needed, then caching may help.

A cached object can be transformed (scale, rotation, position, skew, alpha)
but if the object inside changes, for instance if the text changes, then updateCache() will need to be called.
Constantly calling updateCache() for instance, an animated blob, will not help performance.
A handy trick is to cache an object before animating and uncaching it after animating
this can improve animation performance and the slight blur of the object is not noticed during animation.

ALSO SEE: updateCache() and uncache()

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle(50, red).cache().center();

timeout(1, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.alpha = .5; // cache does not have to be updated to see alpha change
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

timeout(2, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.color = blue;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.updateCache(); // cache must be updated to see color change
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

EXAMPLE
// cache text as it is animated
new Label("Cached Text")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.cache() // cache the text so animation is smoother
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.alp(0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.animate({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props:{alpha:1},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time:2,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call:target=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;target.uncache(); // uncache the label so it is crisper looking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
});

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** cache dimensions will be set to the bounds of the object if the first two or four parameters are not provided
width||x - (default getBounds().x) the width of the chache - or the x if first four parameters are provided
height||y - (default getBounds().y) the height of the chache - or the y if first four parameters are provided
width - (default getBounds().width) the width of the chache - or null if first two parameters are provided
height - (default getBounds().height) the height of the chache - or null if first two parameters are provided
scale - (default 1) set to 2 to cache with twice the fidelity if later scaling up
options - (default null) additional parameters for cache logic - see CreateJS somewhere for details
margin - (default 0) add or subtract a margin from the bounds
eg. margin:10 will make the cache size 10 pixels more on all sides
this can be handy when caching objects with borders - that go half outside the natural bounds

[42095] obj.on(type, listener, scope, once, data, useCapture)

on
CreateJS method
https://createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/Container.html#method_on

DESCRIPTION
Captures events.  Similar to addEventListener() in raw JavaScript
but is shorter to write and has a few extra features.

Generally, events are when interactivity occurs or ZIM has a message.
Here are some types:
"click", "dblclick", "mousedown/pressdown", "pressmove", "pressup",
"mousemove", "stagemousemove", "mouseover", "mouseout"
"ready", "complete", "change", "keydown", "keyup"

The events available for ZIM Objects are listed at the bottom of their Doc entry.
Events can also be turned off in a couple ways - see the examples.
To turn the event off the return value of the on() method is used
so DO NOT CHAIN THE ON METHOD

ALSO SEE: off() and tap(), change(), movement(), hov(), hold()

EXAMPLE
// BASIC EVENT
const button = new Button().center();
// the type of event as a string and the function to call
// here we use an arrow function
button.on("click", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zgo("https://zimjs.com", "_blank");
});

// alternatively, using an anonymous function
button.on("click", function() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zgo("https://zimjs.com", "_blank");
});

// alternatively, using a named function
// do not put () after the function name
// that would call the function right away which is not desired
// we want to tell the on() method which function to run when the event happens
button.on("click", doClick);
function doClick() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zgo("https://zimjs.com", "_blank");
}

EXAMPLE
// EVENT OBJECT
const tile = new Tile(new Rectangle(), 5, 5, 2, 2).center();
tile.on("mousedown", e=&gt;{ // collect the event object in parameter e
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// e.target is the object that caused the event (one of the rectangles)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.target.alpha = 0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// e.currentTarget is the object on which the event is placed (the tile)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.target.mov(5);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// do not forget to update stage in events if needed!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

EXAMPLE
// REMOVING EVENT
let keyEvent = F.on("keydown", e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(e.keyCode); // will tell code for key pressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// etc.
});
timeout(2, ()=&gt;{ // time in seconds as of ZIM Cat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// remove the keyEvent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.off("keydown", keyEvent);
});

// RE-ADDING EVENT
timeout(4, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// add the keyEvent back again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// note - the event must be re-assigned to use again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// this leads to a tricky bug if not careful!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keyEvent = F.on("keydown", keyEvent);
});
timeout(6, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// remove the keyEvent again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// this only works if we re-assigned the latest event to keyEvent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// which is why we used let rather than const
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.off("keydown", keyEvent);
});

EXAMPLE
// ONE EVENT CALL
// call this function only once when mousing over the stage
// note: "mousemove" would only trigger if moving over an object on the stage
S.on("stagemousemove", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pauseAnimate(false); // unpause all animations
}, null, true); // this true means remove the event after calling it once

// REMOVE METHOD
// a remove() method is available on the event object
const circle = new Circle();
circle.on("mouseover", e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.alpha -= .1;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (circle.alpha &lt;= .5) e.remove();
});

PARAMETERS
type - the type of event as a string - this depends on the object on which the event is being placed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here are some common events - see the EVENTS section of the specific object for more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"click", "dblclick", "mousedown/pressdown", "pressmove", "pressup",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"mousemove", "stagemousemove", "mouseover", "mouseout"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"ready", "complete", "change", "keydown", "keyup"
listener - the function to call when the event happens&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is often an arrow function or an anonymous function but can be a named function
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the function will receive an event object as its parameter often collected as e
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see https://createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/MouseEvent.html for properties, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;common event object properties are:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;target (what caused the event),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;currentTarget (what the event was placed on)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keyCode (for key events)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;often used as e.target, e.currentTarget, e.keyCode&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
scope - (optional) the scope to execute the listener in.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defaults to the dispatcher/currentTarget for function listeners,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to the listener itself for object listeners (ie. using handleEvent).
once - (default false) set to true to remove the listener after the first event call
data - (default null) arbitrary data that will be included as the second parameter when the listener is called.
useCapture - (default false) for events that bubble, indicates whether to listen for the event in the capture or bubbling/target phase

RETURNS a reference to use as the second parameter of the off() method to turn the event off (SO DO NOT CHAIN THE ON METHOD)

DESCRIPTION
Removes all event listeners or all event listeners of a certain type

ALSO SEE: on() and off()

************************************
[42306] obj.getBounds()

getBounds
CreateJS method
https://createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/Container.html#method_getBounds

DESCRIPTION
Gets bounds data for a Display Object (with bounds set).
This will have x, y, width and height properties.
Imagine the bounds as an invisible rectangle around the object.
The bounds are what dictate the width and height of an object (along with scale).
The bounds will affect how an object is positioned with pos().
The bounds also may affect certain types of hitTests.

Most ZIM DisplayObjects have their bounds set automatically.
Shape() however does not have its bounds set automatically.

ALSO SEE: setBounds()

EXAMPLE
const rect = new Rectangle(100, 100, blue).center();
zog(rect.getBounds()); // {x:0, y:0, width:100, height:100}

const circle = new Circle(100, red).center(); // 100 is the radius
zog(circle.getBounds()); // {x:-100,y:-100,width:200,height:200}
// note that a Circle has its origin (0,0) in the middle
// so half the bounds goes to the left and above
// and the width and height are twice the radius

// Also note that the registration point is completely independent from the bounds
// and independent from the origin.  See https://codepen.io/zimjs/pen/qBEjYZV

RETURNS object with x, y, width and height properties


************************************
[42347] obj.setBounds(width||x||Boundary, height||y, null||width, null||height)

setBounds
zim DisplayObject method overrides CreateJS setBounds() method with more flexible parameters
https://createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/Container.html#method_setBounds

DESCRIPTION
Sets bounds for a Display Object.
Imagine the bounds as an invisible rectangle around the object.
The bounds are what dictate the width and height of an object (along with scale).
The bounds will affect how an object is positioned with pos().
The bounds also may affect certain types of hitTests.

Most ZIM DisplayObjects have their bounds set automatically.
Shape() however does not have its bounds set automatically.
The setBounds() method will override any automatic bounds.

ALSO SEE: getBounds()

EXAMPLE
new Shape().f(red).dr(0,0,100,100).setBounds(100,100).center();
// without bounds set on the shape, it would not center properly

EXAMPLE
// Containers have two options for how bounds are determined
// 1. the size can be passed in to start in which case these bounds will remain unchanged
// 2. or no size can be passed in which means the bounds will grow to the contents
// setting bounds to null will convert a type 1 container into a type 2 container
const holder = new Container(100,100).center();
new Rectangle(200,200).addTo(holder);
// currently the bounds are {x:0,y:0,width:100,height:100}
holder.setBounds(null);
// now the bounds are {x:0,y:0,width:200,height:200}
new Rectangle(300,300).addTo(holder);
// now the bounds are {x:0,y:0,width:300,height:300}
holder.setBounds(100,100);
// now the bounds are back to {x:0,y:0,width:100,height:100}
// this example just demonstrates it would not be very practical

PARAMETERS
width||x||Boundary - (default null) the width of the bounds - or the x if four parameters are provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or a ZIM Boundary Object {x,y,width,height} - same as CreateJS Rectangle
height||y - (default width) the height of the bounds - or the y if four parameters are provided
width - (default null) the width of the bounds - or null if only the first two parameters are provided
height - (default null) the height of the bounds - or null if only the first two parameters are provided

[42403] obj.localToGlobal(x, y)

localToGlobal
zim DisplayObject method overrides CreateJS localToGlobal() method with adjustment for scaled stage due to retina pixel density
https://createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/Container.html#method_localToGlobal

DESCRIPTION
Returns a point on the stage for the provided x and y within the object's (container's) coordinate system.

BACKGROUND
Each container has its own x and y coordinate system.  The stage is said to be the global coordinate system.
Since containers may be located at different x and y positions and nested inside one another and scaled, rotated or skewed,
finding the matching x and y position within different coordinates can be tricky to calculate.
Traditionally in Interactive Media, three methods have been provided to translate x and y between coordinate systems.

localToGlobal() finds the global x and y of a specified x and y inside the container object
globalToLocal() finds the x and y inside the container object of a specified global x and y
localToLocal() finds the x and y inside an other specified container of a specified x an y inside the container object
SEE: https://zimjs.com/editor/view/Z_N5E7Z

ALSO SEE: globalToLocal() and localToLocal()

EXAMPLE
const holder = new Container(400,400).loc(100,100);
const circle = new Circle.center(holder);
zog(holder.localToGlobal(circle.x, circle.y)); // {x:300, y:300}
// Note: and easier way providing the same result is:
zog(circle.localToGlobal(0,0)); // {x:300, y:300}

PARAMETERS
x - (default null) the x position inside the container
y - (default null) the y position inside the container

RETURNS a Point with x and y properties on the stage (global) that match the provide x and y inside the container

ALSO SEE: localToGlobal() and localToLocal()

EXAMPLE
const rect = new Rectangle(500,500,red).center();

localToLocal
zim DisplayObject method overrides CreateJS localToLocal() method with adjustment for scaled stage due to retina pixel density
https://createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/Container.html#method_localToLocal

DESCRIPTION
Returns a point with x and y positions inside the provided target container's coordinate system
that match the x and y within the object's (container's) coordinate system.

BACKGROUND
Each container has its own x and y coordinate system.  The stage is said to be the global coordinate system.

************************************
[42538] obj.clone(exact)

clone
zim DisplayObject method overrides CreateJS cache()
https://createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/Container.html#method_clone

DESCRIPTION
Makes a copy of the DisplayObject (and children).
The clone() method is particularily handy for making multiple assets from a single asset()
Although new Pic() instead of asset() is automatically cloned to give a new object each new Pic()

ALSO SEE: duplicate() to duplicate custom properties as well

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle(100, red).center();
circle2 = circle.clone().pos(100,100,RIGHT,BOTTOM); // make a copy and position at bottom right

EXAMPLE
asset("pic.jpg").center();
asset("pic.jpg").pos(100,100,RIGHT,BOTTOM); // will just move the existing asset to the corner
asset("pic.jpg").clone().pos(100,100,RIGHT,TOP); // will add a copy of the asset at the top
new Pic("pic.jpg").pos(0,100,CENTER); // no need to clone() a new Pic()

PARAMETERS
exact (default false) ZIM VEE (Pick) values are active in clones unless exact is set to true
For instance, if a Container holds a new Circle(20,[blue,green])
then its clone might be blue or green
If exact is set to true then the clone will be whatever color was picked for the original circle

RETURNS the object for chaining


************************************
[42577] obj.dispose(disposing)

dispose
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Deletes the DisplayObject from memory.
This means it removes event listeners, stops animations, drags, gestures, transforms, etc.
The references to the DisplayObject must still be set to null for proper garbage collection.
Objects that have references to them may still be saved in memory
and this can lead to memory leaks if many objects are being made.

The average DisplayObject added to the stage and removed does not really need to be disposed()
Only when hundreds or thousands of objects are being made will there be need for dispose()

SEE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTnNicsLP3A // on memory management

EXAMPLE
const tile = new Tile(new Pic("pic.jpg"), 100, 100).center();
const tilesArray = [tile]; // if we had an array of such tiles
const tilesObject = {fave:tile}; // if we had a reference in an object literal
timeout(10, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tile.dispose(); // will recursively dispose all children in Tile (the Bitmaps)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tile = null; // remove the reference to tile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tilesArray[0] = null; // set the array reference to null
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delete tilesObject.fave; // delete the property in the object literal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

PARAMETERS
disposing - (default null) pass in true to indicate already started dispose if calling dispose() on the super class from a custom class
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise infinite looping can occur (used internally by ZIM)

RETURNS the object for chaining


************************************
[42621] obj.addTo(container, index, localToLocal)

addTo
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
A wrapper function for addChild() / addChildAt() to add the obj to the container.
This allows us to chain more effectively:
var circle = new Circle().addTo(stage).drag();
Also, ZIM has obj.center(container) and obj.centerReg(container) functions
where the obj comes first followed by the container.
So it is a pain to flip things and use container.addChild(obj)
Now, we can use obj.addTo(container) and the object we are adding comes first.
The index parameter is similar to an addChildAt()
We can also use obj.removeFrom() to automatically remove from the container

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle(50, red);
circle.addTo(stage); // or just circle.addTo(); // for the default frame's stage
// with chaining - and dragging:
var circle = new Circle(50, red).addTo().drag();

const rect = new Rectangle(100, 100, blue);
rect.addTo(stage, 0); // place on bottom

EXAMPLE
// Changing Coordinates
// An object may appear to change positions
// when you add from one container to another (the stage is a container too).
// This happens because the x and y origin inside the containers may be at different places
// yet the x and y property of the object remains unchanged.
// The localToLocal parameter converts between the coordinates and updates the x and y
// so that the object does not appear to jump - this defaults to true

const container = new Container().pos(100,100);
const rectangle = new Rectangle(200, 200, yellow).addTo(container);
// we want to drag the container and the circle
// but when the circle is in the container we want to drag the circle independently
// this leads to a tricky situation that can be solved as follows:
rectangle.on("mousedown", function() {container.drag({currentTarget:true});});
rectangle.on("pressup", function() {container.noDrag();});

const circle = new Circle(50, blue).center().drag();
// check to see if the circle is over the container and if so then add the circle
// try settin the third parameter to false to see what would normally happen
circle.on("pressup", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (rectangle.hitTestReg(circle)) { // do not hitTest the container!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.addTo(container); // keep position with default true as third parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} else {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.addTo(stage);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
container - (default first frame's stage) the container to add to
index - (default null) if provided will addChildAt the object at the index (0 being bottom)
localToLocal - (default true) makes object not move when added from one coordinate space to another
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this also may change the objects x and y properties - set to false not to do this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;localToLocal is ignored if object currently does not have a parent

DESCRIPTION
A chainable wrapper function for removeChild() that removes the obj from the container
Matches obj.addTo(container)
We have obj.removeFrom(container)

NOTE: do not need to specify container as removeFrom()
will remove the object from its parent.

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle(50, red);
circle.addTo(); // adds to stage
// later
circle.removeFrom(); // same as circle.removeFrom(stage)

PARAMETERS
container - (default the object's parent) the container to remove the object from

RETURNS obj for chaining

************************************
[42743] obj.added(call, interval, maxTime)

added
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Calls callback function when object is added to the stage
CreateJS has an "added" event that triggers when an object is added to another container
but this container may not be on the stage.
added polls several times quickly and then every 100ms to see if the object has a stage property
Once it does then it calls the callback and removes the interval

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle(50, red);
circle.added(()=&gt;{zog("has stage");});

PARAMETERS
callback - the function to call when added - will call right away if object is already added
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call will receive a reference to the stage and the object as parameters
** these two parameters are depricated as added no longer uses an interval as of ZIM Cat 03 patch
** but rather uses the "added" event and then checks to make sure it was the stage container the target was added to

[42821] obj.centerReg(container, index, add)

centerReg
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Centers the registration point on the bounds - obj must have bounds set.
Will default to adding the object to the container.
If no container parameter is provided and the object is in a container,
centerReg will center the object in the current container. Thanks Bracer Jack for the suggestion.
If no container and the object is not in a container,
centerReg will center the object on the default frame's stage.
A convenience function for setting both registration points at once.
Also see center() for centering without changing the registration point.
Also see reg(CENTER) for the same effect but without adding to container

SEE: https://zimjs.com/positioning

EXAMPLE
const rect = new Rectangle(100, 100, blue)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.centerReg() // centers registration, centers and adds to stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.animate({obj:{rotation:360}, time:1, ease:"linear", loop:true});

// To just center the registration and not add it to a container
// use rect.centerReg(null, null, false);
// This is different than in the past where leaving out parameters would just center the registration
// The change is to match the default behaviour of addTo() and center() to add to stage without parameters

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
container - (default object's parent or if none, the first frame's stage) centers the object on and adds to the container
index - (default null) if provided will addChildAt the object at the index (0 being bottom)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be ignored if the add parameter is false
add - (default true) set to false to only center the object's registration
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting to false will not remove the object if already added to a container

RETURNS obj for chaining

If no container parameter is provided and the object is in a container,
center will center the object in the current container. Thanks Bracer Jack for the suggestion.
If no container and the object is not in a container,
center will center the object on the default frame's stage.
Also see centerReg() for centering registration point at same time.

[43092] obj.pos(x, y, horizontal, vertical, container, index, add, reg, regX, regY)

pos
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Chainable convenience function to position an object and optionally add to a container
pos() provides easy positioning around the edges of a container.

pos() has gone through three versions:
VERSION 1 - positioned the registration point and has been replaced with loc()
VERSION 2 - positioned left, right top or bottom with right and bottom being specified with boolean true
VERSION 3 - positions left, right, center, top and bottom with ZIM positioning constants

pos() positions objects from the edges of the container or on the stage if no container provided
This defaults to the left of the object from the left and the top of the object from the top
If the horizontal parameter is set to RIGHT it will position the right of the object from the right of the container
If the vertical parameter is set to BOTTOM it will position the bottom of the object from the bottom of the container
If CENTER is provided, it centers the object on the axis and then moves it the x or y provided
Setting reg (or regX, regY) to true will position to the registration point - also see POSREG constant

SEE: https://zimjs.com/positioning

EXAMPLE
// 1. adds circle to default stage moves left and top of circle to 100, 100
circle1.pos(100, 100);

// 2. adds circle to box and positions right and bottom of circle 100 and 200
// from right and bottom of box bounds
circle2.pos(100, 200, RIGHT, BOTTOM, box)
// or
circle2.pos(100, 200, RIGHT, "bottom", box)
// or
circle2.pos(100, 200, true, true, box);

// 3. centers the circle in x and moves 100 and places circle 200 from bottom
circle3.pos(100, 200, CENTER, BOTTOM);

// 4. adds to stage and puts registration point at x=200 and y=0
circle4.pos({x:200, reg:true});

// 5. adds to stage and puts registration point at x=200 and y=radius (not y=0)
circle5.pos({x:200, regX:true});

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
x - (default null or 0 for right) the x distance in the container to the left or right side of the object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which side, depends on the right parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if reg or regX is true then it is the distance to the registration point not the side
y - (default null or 0 for bottom) the y distance in the container to the top or bottom of the object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which one, depends on the bottom parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if reg or regY is true then it is the distance to the registration point not the top or bottom
horizontal - (default LEFT) LEFT will position the left side to the left side of the container bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to RIGHT to postion the right side from the right of the container bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if reg or regX is true then it is the distance to the registration point not the side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to CENTER or MIDDLE to center object and move amount provided in x
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if reg or regX is true then centers the registration point and moves the amount provided in x
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to START to position LEFT for ZIM DIR constant is "ltr" or RIGHT when DIR="rtl" - END is the opposite
vertical - (default TOP) TOP will position the top side to the top side of the container bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to BOTTOM to postion the bottom side from the bottom of the container bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if reg or regY is true then it is the distance to the registration point not the side
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to CENTER or MIDDLE to center object and move amount provided in y
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if reg or regY is true then centers the registration point and moves the amount provided in y
container - (default current container or zdf stage) the Container to add the obj to and position
index - (default null) if provided will addChildAt the object at the index (0 being bottom)
add - (default true) add to container - set to false to not add
reg - (default false) set to true to position to the registration point rather than sides, top or bottom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See: POSREG contant - set POSREG=true; to change the default pos() to position the registration point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is good to adjust legacy code - or if the original pos setting is preferred.
regX - (default reg) set to true to position x to the registration point rather than the sides
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will override reg if provided
regY - (default reg) set to true to position y to the registration point rather than the top or bottom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will override reg if provided

PROPERTIES
zimPos - added to the obj and holds an object with the initial pos() parameter values as follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{x,y,h,v,i} for x, y, horizontal, vertical and index.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: to get the container ask for the obj parent property

DESCRIPTION
A chainable method to set the depth property of a Display object for use with ZIM VR().
When the object is added to VR it will be cloned into two channels and shifted left and right based on its depth.
A depth of 0 will not shift the object and this will appear flat on the screen.
A depth of 20 will shift 20 pixels left and right and appear to come out of the screen.
A depth of -20 will appear to go into the screen.
Depending on the VR parallax settings, depth can also affect parallax.
A negative depth does not unless negativeParallax is set to true in the VR parameters.

PARAMETERS
depth - (default 0) the apparent depth in ZIM VR - or set the depth property

RETURNS obj for chaining


************************************
[44150] obj.nam(name)

nam
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
A chainable method to set the name property of a DisplayObject.
The object can then be accessed with object("name") (or zim.object("name") if zns is true)

BACKGROUND
CreateJS provides Containers with a name property and a getChildByName() method
but you have to remember to ask the parent container for the child and it is a little lengthy.
In ZIM Cat 01, nam() and object() were introduced as a global way to handle object names.
Usually, a variable name is used to reference objects but the name offers an alternative.

Note: naming an object with the same name will overwrite earlier names accessible through object()
This will NOT remove the name property from the previous object
So it is possible that the previous object can still be accessed with parent.getChildByName()
parent.getChildByName() will find the first child with that name in the container
object() will find the last named object with that name anywhere
We could remove previous name properties with the same name but we decided not to
Let us know your thoughts at zimjs.com/slack

EXAMPLE
new Circle().nam("ball").center();

// see what names there are:
zog(object.getNames()); // ["ball"] - if only "ball" has been named

if (mobile()) object("ball").sca(2);
else object("ball").dispose();

zog(object.getNames()); // [] - if only "ball" has been named

object("ball").tap(e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(e.target.name); // "ball"
});

PARAMETERS
name - a String to set the name property of the object

RETURNS obj for chaining


************************************
[44210] obj.movement(call)

movement
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Chainable convenience method that captures mouse movement over an object.
This triggers when a mouseover is active and stagemousemovement dispatches.
It also triggers when a pressmove dispatches - so good for mobile.
A callback function is called on movement.

NOTE: set an object's noMovement property to true to remove these events

SEE: noMovement() as well

EXAMPLE
const pic = new Pic("picture.jpg").center().movement(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mask.widthOnly = F.mouseX-pic.x;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});
const mask = new Rectangle(pic.width, pic.height, F.color).loc(pic).ord(-1);
pic.setMask(mask, true); // dynamic


RETURNS obj for chaining


************************************
[44266] obj.noMovement()

RETURNS obj for chaining


************************************
[44289] obj.tap(call, distance, time, once, dbl, dblTime, call2, call3, call4)

tap
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Chainable convenience method that adds a mousedown and mouseup event to the object
that requires the to move less than distance parameter
This is more like a proper click - down up without dragging.
This method works on desktop or mobile, etc.
An optional time parameter is provided if a minimum time is desired.
Note that a click event also works on mobile as a "tap"
but click also allows dragging between down and up presses - so really is a mouseup.
This will automatically add a cursor of "pointer"
which can be changed with the cursor property or cur() method

When dbl is set to true call will be called when a double tap occurs
With this setting, tap also handles either a single or double tap by providing call3 or call4.
call3 will call if a single tap happens regardless of whether there is a double tap or not
call4 will call if a single tap happens and there is no double tap
this means it waits for the double tap time to fail and then calls call4
To give a more responsive single tap it reduces the default dblTime value

NOTE: tap() ignores List titleBar and organizer as to not conflict with tapping on actual list
NOTE: set an object's noTap property to true to avoid activating a hold on an object

SEE: noTap() as well

EXAMPLE
new Circle(50, red).tap(e=&gt;{

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

EXAMPLE
new Button().tap(e=&gt;{

});

EXAMPLE
// wanting to do one thing on single tap and another thing on double tap on same object
// this will set the default dblTime to .5 seconds (rather than 1 second)
new Rectangle().center().tap({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dbl:true,

});

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
call - the function to call when clicked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call will receive the event object as a parameter (with target, currentTarget, etc. properties)
distance - (default 5 or 10 if dbl is true) distance in pixels within which the mouseup must occur for a click to be counted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if dbl is true it will lengthen the default distance to give an easier double tap
time - (default 8) time in seconds within which the mouseup must occur for a click to be counted - also see TIME constant
once - (default false) set to true to capture only one click then auto-remove listeners
dbl - (default false) set to true to capture a double click - this works on mobile where dblclick may not
dblTime - (default 1 or .5 if call4) time in seconds from first pressup to pressup a second time to count as a double tap - also see TIME constant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if call4 is provided it will shorten the default dbl tap time to give a more responsive single tap alternative
call2 - (default null) a function to call on pressup if a tap is not made
call3 - (default null) with dbl set to true, a function to call on single tap regardless of a double tap or not
call4 - (default null) with dbl set to true, a function to call on single tap only if double tap fails

[44481] obj.hold(call, distance, time, once)

hold
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Chainable convenience method that adds a press and hold event to the object
The callback function will run after the object is held for a certain time without moving the object
This method can be used on mobile to replace shift keys, etc.
This will automatically add a cursor of "pointer" - although mobile will not see it
which can be changed with the cursor property or cur() method

NOTE: set an object's noHold property to true to avoid activating a hold on an object

SEE: noHold() as well

EXAMPLE
// remove circle if held for 1000 ms (one second)
new Circle(50, red).hold(e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.target.removeFrom();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

PARAMETERS
call - the function to call after hold time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call will receive the event object as a parameter (with target, currentTarget, etc. properties)
distance - (default 5) distance in pixels within which the mouseup must occur for a hold to be counted
time - (default 1.5) time in seconds before hold is activated
once - (default false) set to true to capture only one click then auto-remove listeners

RETURNS obj for chaining

drag
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Adds drag and drop to an object with a variety of options.
Handles scaled, rotated nested objects.
Also see draggable property for setting a default drag() and noDrag()
and to indicate whether a drag has been set.

NOTE: drag() will stop ZIM Swipe() from triggering a swipe event.
Set the overridNoSwipe parameter of ZIM Swipe() to true to capture swipe events.

NOTE: also see the draggable property - set to true for basic drag() and false for noDrag()

EXAMPLE
const radius = 50;
const circle = new Circle(radius, red);
circle.center();
circle.drag();

// OR with chaining
new Circle(radius, red).center().drag();

// OR with ZIM DUO
circle.drag({slide:true});

// BOUNDARY
// circle has its registration point in the middle
// keep registration point within rectangle starting at x=100, y=100
// and drag within a width of 500 and height of 400
const boundary = new Boundary(100,100,500,400);
circle.drag(boundary);

// or keep circle on the stage with the following
const boundary = new Boundary(0,0,W,H).contract(radius);
circle.drag(boundary); // drag within stage

// or by passing the stage (or a Container as a boundary)
circle.drag(stage); // drag within stage

EXAMPLE
// dragging only horizontal or vertical at a time
const circle = new Circle(50,red).center().drag();
circle.on("mousedown", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const start = {x:circle.x, y:circle.y};

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}, null, true); // once
});
circle.on("pressup", ()=&gt;{circle.dragBoundary()});

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
boundary - (default null) a ZIM Boundary object for the drag boundary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or a ZIM DisplayObject including stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the boundary is a display object then ZIM will keep the shape of the dragged object inside the bounds.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the boundary object is a Blob then the dragged object will stay within the Blob (experimental).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the boundary object is a Circle then the registration point of the dragged object will stay within the circle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the drag is on a container and the "all" parameter is false
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then ZIM will call drag methods on each child so the bound calculations are easier.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drags will be applied after a .05 second delay allowing items to be added directly after.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, drag() can be placed on the container AFTER the objects are added
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the immediateBoundary parameter set to true. Or drag() can be applied manually on each child.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a boundary with 0 width will drag vertically.  A boundary with 0 height will drag horizontally
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or see the axis parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: boundary will only work in 90-degree-rotated containers - as such, do slant Window and List, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If surround is true then it will make sure the obj surrounds the boundary rather than stays within it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This boundary is relative to the stage (global).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a boundary relative to the object's parent is desired then set the localBoundary parameter to true.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rectangle, Stage, StageGL - will keep object fully inside the bounds (based on bounds of object when adding drag).
axis - (default BOTH) or HORIZONTAL or VERTICAL - set the axis of the drag
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see the boundary parameter where the width can be set to 0 for vertical dragging with a limit of y and the height
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the height can be set to 0 for horizontal dragging with limit of x and the width
overCursor - (default "pointer") the CSS cursor property as a string for rolling over the object
dragCursor - (default "pointer") the CSS cursor property as a string for pressing and dragging the object
all - (default false) set to true to drag a whole container rather than its parts (was called currentTarget)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. container.drag(); will drag any object within the container
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;container.drag({all:true}) will drag the whole container
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See: DRAGALL contant - set DRAGALL=true; to change the default drag to drag a whole container
swipe - (default false) which prevents a swipe from triggering when dragging
localBoundary - (default false) which means the rect is global - set to true for a rect in the object parent frame
onTop - (default true) brings the dragged object to the top of the container - unless Keyboard at top.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// to drag on top of keyboard, set the type property of the keyboard to "LowerKeyboard" - or anything other than Keyboard
surround - (default false) is for dragging a big object that always surrounds the boundary
slide - (default false) will let you throw the object and dispatch a slidestop event when done
slideFactor - (default .9) is the factor multiplied by dragging velocity (1 no slowing, .7 fast slowing)
slideSnap - (default true) lets the object go outside and snap back to bounds - also VERTICAL, HORIZONTAL, and false
slideSnapDamp - (default .1) the damping to snap back to boundary
reg - (default false) when set to true will snap the registration of the object to the mouse position
removeTweens - (default true) will automatically remove any tweens that have an x and y set unless set to false
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if, for example, animate() has a rotation and an x set, then both will be canceled
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but if an animate() call to rotation and another to x is set then only the x would be canceled and rotation would continue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if after dropping, the animation in x should continue, then a new animate() in x will need to be called
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this avoids conflict between dragging and animating position which is very confusing for beginner coders
startBounds - (default true) set to false to ignore bound rect before dragging (sometimes handy when putting drag on container)
rect - (depreciated) same as boundary - kept for backwards compatibility when using config object
currentTarget - (default false) same as the all parameter - kept for backwards compatibility when using config object
offStage - (default false) set to true to be able to drag object off stage (thanks Shammi!)
immediateBoundary - (default false) set to true to add bounds immediately when drag() is set on a Container.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is normally set to false for a .05 second delay to allow objects to be added to Container before setting bounds.
singleTouch - (default false) set to true to let only one touch operate the drag
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see Frame() singleTouch setting - but setting on drag will only affect that object's drag

note: will not update stage if OPTIMIZE is set to true
unless Ticker.update is set to true or you run Ticker.always(stage) see zim.Ticker

PROPERTIES
adds a dragPaused property to get or set the pause of the drag - which allows setting to be kept
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see also noDrag() where settings will be removed

EVENTS
Adds a "slidestart" event to the drag object that is dispatched when the object starts sliding - if slide is true
Adds a "slidestop" event to the drag object that is dispatched when the object comes to rest after sliding - if slide is true

************************************
[45417] obj.noDrag(recursive)

noDrag
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Removes drag function from an object.
This is not a stopDrag function (as in the drop of a drag and drop).
Dropping happens automatically with the drag() function.
The noDrag function turns off the drag function so it is no longer draggable.

EXAMPLE
circle.noDrag();

PARAMETERS
recursive (default true) - turns off drags on children

RETURNS obj for chaining


************************************
[45474] obj.dragBoundary(boundary)

dragBoundary
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Dynamically changes or adds a boundary rectangle to the object being dragged with drag().

NOTE: replaces old ZIM dragRect() method

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle().center().drag();
// add (or change) a boundary 5 seconds later
timeout(5, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const boundary = new Boundary(100,100,500,400);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.dragBoundary(boundary);
});

PARAMETERS
boundary - is a ZIM Boundary object for the bounds - the local / global does not change from the original drag
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass in null to remove the boundary - the boundary while dragging and be removed for next mousedown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to solve this issue while dragging, set a boundary of the stage size or larger...

[45511] obj.mouse()

mouse
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Sets object's mouseChildren and mouseEnabled properties to true
These are the defaults - used primarily to reverse ZIM noMouse()
which can be used to turn off mouseChildren and mouseEnabled

NOTE: just using mouse() does not add cursors or interactivity
see cur(), hov(), drag(), transform(), gesture(), or various mouse events

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle().drag();
timeout(1, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.noMouse(); // circle cannot not be dragged, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timeout(1, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.mouse(); // circle can be dragged
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
});

RETURNS obj for chaining


************************************
[45545] obj.noMouse()

noMouse
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Sets object's mouseChildren and mouseEnabled properties to false
This can be used to save processing on complex objects that do not need interactivity

NOTE: this will prevent interactivity for cur(), hov(), drag(), transform(), gesture()
and any mouse events like mousedown, click, mouseover, etc.

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle().drag();
timeout(1, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.noMouse(); // circle cannot not be dragged, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timeout(1, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.mouse(); // circle can be dragged
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});

************************************
[45579] obj.wire(target, prop, twoWay, setSource, filter, call, input)

wire
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
The wire() method connects an object (source) property to another object (target) property.
This can be one way (default) or two way with the twoWay parameter set to true.
For instance:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Slider().center().wire(circle, "scale"); // note the property as string
will change the scale of the circle as the slider's current value changes.
The currentValue (if the object has one) is the default input followed by selectedIndex.
If the source object has neither currentValue nor selectedIndex
then the input is the same property as the target property.
For instance:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Circle().center().wire(circle2, "x", true);
would mean changing either circle's x property would change the other.
Multiple wire() methods can be chained.
For instance:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slider.wire(circle, "x").wire(circle, "y");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slider.wire(circle, "scale").wire(circle2, "scale");

BACKGROUND
The wire system is an alternative to events at 25% the size of traditional JS addEventListener.
It is a single extra conditional in the Ticker that checks to see if a Dictionary list has length.
If it does it cycles through the list to see if input properties have changed
and if so, sets the target property.  Updates are batched to a single stage update
This is the same stage update that is used by any Ticker functions including those by drag, animate, etc.
Basically, wire is same system as events but with a more specific format - adds 1.4 k to ZIM file size.

WIRED
There is also a wired() method that can be be put on the target object
and points to a source object to set a specified property.
This just flips the target and the source and calls the wire() function.
The methods MUST go on the second object made - so using either wire() or wired() covers use cases.
There are also noWire() and noWired() methods to remove connections - with various alternatives.

FILTER AND CALLBACK
wire is also similar to ZIM Bind and bind() but binds within ZIM where bind binds outside of ZIM.
Like Bind, wire uses an optional filter and callback function.
For instance:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Dial().center().wire(tone, "volume", null, filter, call);
will call the filter function before setting the target property (tone.volume).
The filter function will receive the data (the input currentValue) as its parameter
and MUST return data to be passed along but the data can be changed or tested.
The call function will be called after the target property is set.

See: https://zimjs.com/cat/wire.html
See: https://zimjs.com/cat/synth.html

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle(100, pink, dark).center();
new Dial({step:0, min:1, max:3})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.wire(circle, "scale");

// S.update(); // depending, let the wire() set the stage update

EXAMPLE
// this time the circle (target) starts at a scale of 2
const circle = new Circle(100, pink, dark).sca(2).center();
// so we want the dial (source) to start at 2 as well
// we could use the Dial parameter currentValue:circle.scale
// or we can use the wire setSource to true
new Dial({step:0, min:1, max:3})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.wire(circle, "scale", null, true); // true for setSource to the target value

// S.update(); // depending, let the wire() set the stage update

EXAMPLE
const rect = new Rectangle(100, 100, blue, dark)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.pos(0,70,CENTER)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.drag(stage);

new Slider({min:0, max:W-100, currentValue:rect.x})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.pos(0,100,CENTER,BOTTOM)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.wire(rect, "x", true, null, data=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (data &lt; 100 || data &gt; W-100-100) rect.color = red;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return data; // filter must return data - even if not changing it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}, data=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (data &gt;= 100 &amp;&amp; data &lt;= W-100-100) rect.color = blue;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});

// timeout(5, ()=&gt;{
// &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slider.noWire(); // remove slider rect wire
// });

EXAMPLE
const person = {num:1, hair:red, eyes:blue}
const shirt = {num:1, color:dark, pocket:dark}
wire(person, shirt, "num"); // will wire person num to shirt num
wired({ // or could use wire() - just showing wired()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;source:person, // will wire person hair property to shirt color property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;input:"hair",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;target:shirt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prop:"color"
});
person.num = 3;
person.hair = blue;
// note: could use addWires(person) to add wire and wired methods to person if desired

timeout(.01, ()=&gt;{ // must wait for Ticker to go
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(shirt.num); // 3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(shirt.color); // blue

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** the current object is called the source - it will be setting the prop on the target
target - the object that has the property to wire to (and change)
prop (default input)- a String name of the property to change on the target
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if no property is provided it assumes the input property if provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the only time no prop would be useful is to wire together components
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a Slider to a Dial where both will default to selectedIndex
twoWay (default false) - also have the change in prop on target change the source object's property
setSource (default false) - initially, by default, wire will change the target value to the source value
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting setSource to true will initially set the source value to the target value
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is independent of twoWay - so the twoWay setting does not matter
filter (default null) - a function to call before the prop is changed on the target (or source object if twoWay is true)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this function receives a data parameter that holds the value of the property that will be changed on the target
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the prop value can be tested or changed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the filter function MUST return the value whether it is modified or not
call (default null) - a function that is called once the property has been set on the target - receives the value as a parameter
input (default DEFAULTWIRE or "currentValue" or "selectedIndex" or prop) - an optional source property as a String
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wire will usually be used to wire a component to a DisplayObject
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and components usually have a currentValue or selectedIndex property that is changing in a change event, for instance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so wire by default uses these if available and a change event is no longer needed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set ZIM DEFAULTWIRE constant to a String of the desired input if different than above.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the source object does not have a currentValue or selectedIndex property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then the same property name as the target prop is used (unless an input is provided here)

************************************
[45825] obj.wired(source, prop, twoWay, setSource, filter, call, input)

wired
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Wires an object's property based on a source - see docs for ZIM wire() for details.
A wiring can be added only if the source object and the target object exist.
For instance we CANNOT do (even if we declare circle first):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Slider().center().wire(circle, "scale");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var circle = new Circle().center();

OPTION 1:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var circle = new Circle().center();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Slider().center().wire(circle, "scale");

OPTION 2:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var slider = new Slider().center();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Circle().center().wired(slider, "scale"); // use wired()

wired() just switches the source and target and calls wired()
See the wire() method for parameters and description

EXAMPLE
const slider = new Slider().center();
new Circle().center().wired(slider, "scale");

[45891] obj.bind(id, props, extra, filter, bindObj)

bind
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Binds the specified object properties to a Bind object's connection.
This could be a connection to localStorage or a server script to a database.
This will allow a cleaner way to save and retrieve data.
See the docs for the ZIM Bind class for more details and examples

See: https://zimjs.com/ten/bind.html

EXAMPLE
// LOCALSTORAGE example
const b = new Bind(); // create a Bind object - defaults to localStorage
// b.clear(); // clear localStorage memory

// bind() will get data remembered in localStorage
// and also set up the binding
const c = new Circle().center().bind("circle", ["x","y"]).drag();

// when we want to update the binding call the to() method
c.on("pressup", function () {b.to();});

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
id - a one-word string ID for the bind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will be used as the JSON key for the data
props - a property to bind as a string or an array of properties, eg. ["x","y"]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or an object literal in the form {prop1:TO, prop2:FROM, prop3:BOTH, prop4:TO, etc.}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by default the property will be bound as BOTH - as in TO and FROM
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this means data would be received on bind.to() calls and sent on bind.from() calls
extra (default null) extra information to be sent to the server (not localStorage)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this could be an id or a search term, etc. it will have encodeURI() applied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can be received in php as $_GET["extra"] or $_POST["extra"] depending on bindType
filter (default null) a function to run before sending and after receiving data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will receive (data, command, extra) parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the function must return the data - see Bind masterFilter parameter for more information
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: the masterFilter if supplied will run as well before the filter
bindObj (default zimDefaultBind) - set to a specific bind object or keep as default
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see also ZIM Bind() setDefault parameter and default property

transform
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
The transform method adds transform controls to a display object.
The controls allow the user to move, scale, stretch, rotate and change the registration point.
Parameters are available to choose which of these transformations are available.
By default, all the transformations are available to use but
only the scale and registration point controls are showing.
The others work as the user rolls over the edges or the outer corners.
You can optionally set these to be visible as boxes on the sides and circles on the outer corners.

NOTE: works with the ZIM TransformManager() class to handle multiple transforms and saving data for persistence.
NOTE: the transformed object will have its mouseChildren set to false.

CLICK turns off and on the controls if allowToggle parameter is set to true (default is true)
If you use the TransformManager for multiple objects, the allowToggle is automatically set to true
SHIFT rotate snaps to 45
Dropping the registration point will snap to corners or center if close enough - unless CTRL is down
CTRL scale will scale about the registration point
CTRL DBLCLICK will reset scale to 1 and rotation to 0

EXAMPLE
rect.transform(); // shows handles for tranformations

EXAMPLE
rect.transform({ // scale and stretch only
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move:false,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rotate:false
});

// hide the rectangle's bottom stretch control so only can stretch from top
// note - transform() expects there to be a control so do not remove a control
// also, the controls have a hitArea so setting alpha to 0 will not work
rect.transformControls.stretchYControls.getChildAt(1).sca(0);
// or set its visible to false
rect.transformControls.stretchYControls.getChildAt(1).visible = false;

// Record the transforms and remake transforms when page reloads
// Or see the TransformManager
if (localStorage &amp;&amp; localStorage.data) rect.transformControls.setData(localStorage.data, true);
rect.on("transformed", function() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (localStorage) localStorage.data = rect.transformControls.recordData(true);
});

// change the color of the controls
var r = new Rectangle(100,100,grey).center().transform({borderColor:blue})
r.transformControls.scaleControls.loop(function (control) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;control.color = blue;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;control.updateCache();

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shows controls if hidden and hides controls if showing (returns the object for chaining)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or pass in true to show controls or false to hide controls

TRANSFORM CONTROL OBJECT
When tranform() is set on an object, the object receives a transformControls property
This holds the following:

PROPERTIES:
visible - read only whether the controls are visible
ghost - read only as to whether the ghost outline is showing - set with showGhost and hideGhost
ghostEnabled - read only as to whether the ghost outline will be turned on and off - set with addGhost and removeGhost

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if toJSON (default false) is set to true, the return value is a JSON string
setData(data, fromJSON) - sets the properties to match the data object passed in - this should come from recordData()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if fromJSON (default false) is set to true, it will assume a JSON string is passed in as data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns object for chaining
remove(noHide) - removes the controls - set noHide true if already hidden

addGhost() - enable ghost outline functionality - the ghostWidth or ghostColor must be set in initial parameters
removeGhost() - disable ghost outline functionality
disable() - may show the controls if visible but cannot use them
enable() - turns the using of the controls back on
resize(dispatch) - call resize if the object is transformed in ways other than with the controls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set dispatch to true to dispatch a "transformed" event - if manually adjusted this will save to TransformManager
dispose() - remove all aspects of transform on object

EVENTS
Adds a "transformed" event to obj that is dispatched when pressup on any of the controls or on click
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the events parameter (or events property on transformControls) is set to true then these happen on pressmove of controls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the transformed event object has a transformType property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the transformType property has values of "select" (if not moved), "size", "move", "rotate", "stretch", "reg" "reset"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the transformed event object also has a pressup property that is true if on pressup and false if from pressmove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;events are turned on automatically for obj type Tag, TextArea and Loader
Adds "transformshow" and "transformhide" events for when click to hide or show controls
If TransformManager() is used there are more events available such as "persistset", etc.

[47197] obj.gesture(move, scale, rotate, boundary, minScale, maxScale, snapRotate, localBoundary, slide, slideFactor, regControl, onTop, surround, circularBounds, rect)

gesture
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Sets multi-touch pan, pinch and rotate for position, scale and rotation
Handles scaled and rotated containers
Scale and rotation occur from the pinch point (with optional regControl for about the registration point)
Note - gesture() only works on the currentTarget - not a container's children (like drag() can)
ZIM Frame should have touch set to true (which is the default for mobile)
ALSO: see the noGesture() method to remove some or all gestures
ALSO: see the gestureBoundary() method to set or reset the boundary rectangle dynamically

EXAMPLE
rect.gesture(); // move, scale and rotate with no bounds

EXAMPLE
rect.gesture({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rotate:false,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boundary:new Boundary(0,0,W,H),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minScale:.5,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maxScale:3,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slide:true
});

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
move - (default true) move the object with average of fingers
scale - (default true) scale the object with first two fingers' pinch
rotate - (default true) rotate the object with first two fingers' rotation
boundary - (default null) ZIM Boundary rectangle with (x,y,w,h) to contain bounds of the object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if surround is true then it will make sure the obj surrounds the boundary rather than stays within it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See circularBounds parameter to keep circular shapes with boundary
minScale - (default null) a minimum scale
maxScale - (default null) a maximum scale
snapRotate - (default 1) degrees to snap rotation to after rotation is finished
localBoundary - (default false) set to true to make rect for bounds local rather than global
slideFactor - (default 5) how much slide with 0 being no slide and then longer slide times and distance like 10, etc.
regControl (default false) set to true to rotate and scale around registration point rather than pinch point
onTop - (default true) brings the object to the top of the container
surround - (default false) is for dragging a big object that always surrounds the rect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must specify a rect and currently not supported unless rotate is false
circularBounds - (default false) set to true if object is circular with center registration
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to true to use radius to calculate rotated object in boundary if boundary is set
rect - (depreciated) same as boundary - kept for backwards compatibility

EVENTS
Adds move, scale and rotate events to obj (when associated gesture parameters are set to true)
If slide is true, obj dispatches a "slidestop" event when sliding stops

EXAMPLE
rect.noGesture(); // removes all gestures
// or
rect.noGesture(true, true, false); // would leave rotation
// or with ZIM DUO
rect.noGesture({rotation:false}); // would leave rotation

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below

DESCRIPTION
Dynamically changes or adds a boundary rectangle to the object being dragged with gesture().

EXAMPLE
const boundary = new Boundary(100,100,500,400); // x,y,w,h
circle.gestureBoundary(boundary);

PARAMETERS
boundary - is a ZIM Boundary rectangle - the local / global does not change from the original gesture setting
update - (default true) reset base drag boundary

RETURNS obj for chaining


************************************
[47749] obj.effect(effect, x, y, width, height)

effect
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Adds an effect to a DisplayObject such as:
blur, glow, shadow, color and alpha mask effects.
Also see hue, saturation, brightness and contrast convenience effects
that are available as properties directly on the DisplayObject.

SEE: https://zimjs.com/cat/effects.html

BATCHING
Effects are processor heavy.  Too many can slow down the application.
ZIM uses effect() to allow multiple effects to be added at once.
These are then internally batched and updated with a single update
rather than making each effect a stand-alone method requiring individual updates.

EFFECTS PROPERTY
The effects added with effect() are stored on the object's effects property.
The effects themselves have properties that can be changed to change the effect.
If an effect is changed the updateEffects() method needs to be called.
ZIM does not do this automatically, allowing the changes to be batched with one call.
See updateEffects() - also see noEffect() to remove effects.

The effect properties and convenience effects can be animated and wiggled.
In this case, the effects will be automatically updated by ZIM.

CREATEJS FILTERS
ZIM Effects wrap the CreateJS filters array and cache/updateCache system.
Using effect() will overwrite manual usage of CreateJS filters array.
The ZIM Effects system remembers effects in the effects property
and overwrites the filters array each time an effect is added or updated.
To update an effect, all the effects need to be re-applied regardless
and all this is automatically handled by ZIM.

EFFECT OBJECTS
The following Effect objects can be passed into effect()
These all have parameters that accept ZIM DUO, VEE and OCT.
See the Doc entries under Controls &gt; Effects.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new BlurEffect() - apply blur
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new GlowEffect() - apply glow and knock out - thanks kudox.jp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new ShadowEffect() - apply drop shadows and knock out - thanks kudox.jp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new ColorEffect() - change colors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new MultiEffect() - combination of hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new AlphaEffect() - apply alpha mask
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
EFFECT IDS
The effects are referred to by id and have ids as follows (case insensitve):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blur, glow, shadow, color, multi, alpha
The id is the property name used to identify the effect
in the object's effects property (plural s):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj.effects.glow.strength = 20; // using the glow id
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj.updateEffects(); // this must be called to see the change
Effect ids are used when animating (and wiggling):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props:{"effects.blur.blurX":200} // no update is needed
To remove effects use noEffect (singular) and use the id as follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj.noEffect(); // remove all effects (except convenience effects - see below)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj.noEffect("glow"); // remove the glow effect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj.noEffect(["glow", "color"]); // remove glow and color effects

CONVENIENCE EFFECTS
hue, saturation, brightness, contrast can be used directly on the object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj.hue = 100; // no need to updateEffects()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// or
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj.hueBatch = 100; // will set the effect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj.updateEffects(); // but updateEffects must be called to see the change
Convenience effects can also be accessed through the multi id:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj.effects.multi.hue = 100;
Any of the four properties can be removed by setting them to 0
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj.hue = 0;
Convenience effects can also ALL be removed together with:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj.noEffect("multi");
The following will NOT remove the convenience effects:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj.noEffect(); // will not remove hue, saturation, brightness and contrast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
NOTE: Effects are quite processor intensive so use sparingly.
Each effect processes every pixel - when animating this results in hundreds of thousands of loops.
ZIM has wrapped the CreateJS filters, filter property, caching and cacheUpdate system
to make accessing filters easy - but apps will slow down if they are over-used.
Keep the quality at 1 for animating filters at a decent framerate.
Consider pre-processing images if effects do not have to be dynamic.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
EXAMPLE
// create a Label with a GlowEffect that shows through to the image below
new Pic("background.jpg").center();
new Label("WOW", 200, "impact")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.effect(new GlowEffect({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color:red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blurX:50,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blurY:50,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strenght:2,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quality:2,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knockout:true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}));

EXAMPLE
// add a glow and shadow effect
// remove only the glow when pressed
const circle = new Circle(100,blue)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.effect([ // apply two effects in an array&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new GlowEffect({color:purple, blurX:100, inner:true}),&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new ShadowEffect(20) // 20 is distance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]);
circle.on("mousedown", ()=&gt;{&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// specify type of effect to remove - otherwise removes all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.noEffect("glow");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

EXAMPLE
// add a 200 blurX effect and animate it to 0 rewind and looping
STYLE = {blurX:200} // just showing using style...
new Pic("image.png") // preloaded asset
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.effect(new BlurEffect())
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.animate({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// the blur effect is stored on the effects property of the object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// and available through the effect id (blur)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// we are animating the blurX of that
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// note the quotes around the DOT property format
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props:{"effects.blur.blurX":0},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time:.7,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rewind:true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rewindWait:.5,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loop:true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
EXAMPLE
// wiggle the saturation of an image asset stored in pic
// so its saturation goes from 50-100 negative or positive in 1-3 seconds
// here we use a convenience effect (hue, saturation, brightness, contrast)
pic.wiggle("saturation", 0, 50, 100, 1, 3);

// This is the same as the following (so may as well use above)
pic.effect(new MultiEffect()).wiggle("effects.multi.saturation", 0, 50, 100, 1, 3);

PARAMETERS
effect - (default null) a ZIM Effect object as detailed above
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or an array of ZIM Effect objects.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effects of a specific type are not compounded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, adding two blur effects will just use the last blur effect added.
x - (default null) the x position of the cache bounds - will cache object bounds by default
y - (default null) the y position of the cache bounds - will cache object bounds by default
width - (default null) the width of the cache bounds - will cache object bounds by default
height - (default null) the height of the cache bounds - will cache object bounds by default

[47933] obj.updateEffects(redoChache)

updateEffects
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Updates an effect when its property or the object's internals are changed.
For example a Sprite changes frame.  Not needed for position, alpha, scale or rotation.
This basically updates the cache on the object so the effects are applied.

Note: setting hue, saturation, brightness and contrast directly on the object will update automatically.
These can be batched by using hueBatch, saturationBatch, etc. which will change but not update
until an obj.updateEffects() is called.

EXAMPLE
// make an object more blurry in x each time it is pressed
const rect = new Rectangle(200,200,red)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.effect(new BlurEffect(10, 0)); // set to 0 in y otherwise it would take default blurY
rect.on("mousedown", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rect.effects.blur.blurX += 20;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rect.updateEffects();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

PARAMETERS
redoCache - (default false) set to true to remake the cache the size of the bounds of the object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if some other size is desired, use obj.cache(width, height) or obj.cache(x,y,width,height) instead of updateEffects()

RETURNS obj for chaining


************************************
[47975] obj.noEffect(effects, cache)

noEffect
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Removes the effects or specified effects from an object.

EXAMPLE
// add a glow and shadow effect
// remove only the glow when pressed
const circle = new Circle(100,blue)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.effect([ // apply two effects in an array&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new ShadowEffect(20) // 20 is distance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]);
circle.on("mousedown", ()=&gt;{&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// specify type of effect to remove - otherwise removes all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.noEffect("glow");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

PARAMETERS
effects - (default null) will remove all effects applied with effect() unless
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an effect string or array of effect strings is provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effect strings are (case insensitive):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"blur", "glow", "shadow", "multi", "alpha"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alternately, "Effect" can be added such as "BlurEffect"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To remove hue, saturation, brightness and contrast set the object property to 0
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for instance obj.hue = 0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or to remove all four then can explicitly use obj.noEffect("multi")
cache - (default false) will uncache object if all effects are gone
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to true to leave object cached

[48042] obj.addPhysics(dynamic, contract, shape, friction, linear, angular, density, bounciness, maskBits, categoryBits, physics, restitution, sensor)

addPhysics
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Add Physics to a DisplayObject.  DisplayObject should be centerReg() on the stage (or in non-transformed Container at 0,0 on stage)
The Physics world can be set up with the ZIM Physics() class in the Controls module.
Box2D and ZIM physics JavaScript helper module need to be imported.
If no physics world has been created, the addPhysics() method will create a default world.
The default world will have a borders around the stage and gravity of 10.
See: https://zimjs.com/physics/

NOTE: Adding physics also adds more methods and properties to the DisplayObject
See the Physics() docs for all the details

EXAMPLE
new Circle().center().addPhysics(); // circle will fall with gravity to the floor

EXAMPLE
// create a world with no gravity (viewed from top like air-hockey)
const physics = new Physics(0);

// create physics objects using the addPhysics() method
const circle = new Circle(50,blue,grey).center().addPhysics({bounciness:1.1});

// make sure to centerReg() any rectangular objects
const rect = new Rectangle(30,400).centerReg().pos(70).addPhysics(false); // static - do not move
const tri = new Triangle(150,150,150,green,grey).center().pos(200).addPhysics({linear:10}); // does not slide easily

// turn on dragging
physics.drag(); // note: to add a boundary use the border parameter of Physics()

PARAMETERS
dynamic - (default true) - set to false to not move the physics body (static)
contract - (default 0) - make the physics body smaller (or bigger with negative) than bounds
shape - (default object shape) - "rectangle" for any object other than Circle, Dial and Triangle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but can specify a "circle" for a Sprite or Bitmap, for instance - to try and match shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;custom polygon bodies can also be made with manual Box2D and then use physics.addMap()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the only shapes available automatically are "rectangle", "circle", "triangle"
friction - (default .8) - how sticky will the body act - set to 0 to slide.
linear - (default .5) - linear damping which slows the movement - set to 0 for no damping
angular - (default .5) - angular damping which slows the rotation - set to 0 for no damping
density - (default 1) - the density that can affect what happens with collisions
bounciness - (default 0) - how bouncy the object is - 0 is not bouncy 4 is crazy bouncy (was restitution)
maskBits - (default null) - used with categoryBits to determine which bodies will collide with which other bodies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as soon as maskBits is specified, the body will collide only with the categoryBits provided to the maskBits parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 will collide with bodies that do not have categoryBits specified including the borders
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to test collision with bodies that have categoryBits specified, use the pipe (|) as follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1|2 will also collide with bodies having categoryBits of 2 specified
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so if another body has categoryBits of 4 then the bodies would not collide.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1|2|4 would also collide with 4 but not bodies with categoryBits of 8, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2|4 would pass through any bodies without categoryBits of 2 or 4 including the borders

************************************
[48436] obj.hitTestCircleRect(other, margin)

hitTestCircleRect
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Uses an equation to see if a circlular object is hitting the rectangle of another object.
DO NOT use with a rotated rectangle object - for that use hitTestRect() or hitTestCircle().
This is faster than hitTests on shapes - so will have the speed of hitTestBounds, hitTestCircles and hitTestGrid.
The circle is based on a the object radius if there is one
and if no radius then the average of the width and height divided by two.
A margin parameter is provided to tweak the hitTest
The rect is based on the bounds of the second object projected globally as a rectangle
If the second object bounds are rotated, the global bounds will be bigger to keep parallel to the axes

EXAMPLE
const ball = new Circle(50, red).center().drag();
const box = new Rectangle(100, 100, blue).loc(100,100);
ball.on("pressmove", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (ball.hitTestCircleRect(box)) {

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
});

PARAMETERS
other - the object whose bounds are used to see if circle shape is hitting
margin (default 0) pixels the distance between the circle and the bounds is increased or decreased to effect the hit

RETURNS a Boolean true if hitting, false if not


************************************
[48502] obj.hitTestCircles(other, margin)

hitTestCircles
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Uses an equation to see if two circles are intersecting.
This is faster than hitTests on shapes - so will have the speed of hitTestBounds and hitTestGrid.
The circles are based on the bounds of the two objects - it does not matter on which object the method is placed.
If the bounds are not square then half the average length of the sides is used as the radius.
A margin parameter is provided to tweak the hitTest

EXAMPLE
const ball = new Circle(50, red).center().drag();
const basket = new Circle(100, blue).loc(100,100);
ball.on("pressmove", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (ball.hitTestCircles(basket)) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog("points!");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
});

PARAMETERS
other - the object whose circle based on the bounding rect we are using
margin (default 0) pixels the distance between circles is increased or decreased to effect the hit

RETURNS a Boolean true if hitting, false if not


************************************
[48559] obj.hitTestBounds(other, margin, boundsShape)

hitTestBounds
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
See if obj.getBounds() is hitting other.getBounds().
Margin can be adjusted to tweak the hitTest.
Pass in a boundsShape shape if you want a demonstration of where the bounds are.

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle(50, red).center().drag();
const rect = new Rectangle(100, 100, blue).loc(100,100);
circle.on("pressmove", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (circle.hitTestBounds(rect)) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.removeChild(rect);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
});

PARAMETERS
other - another object whose rectanglular bounds we are testing
margin (default 0) shifted distance in pixels before hit is counted - can be positive or negative
boundsShape - (default null) an empty Shape or createjs.Shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you would need to add the boundsShape to the stage

RETURNS a Boolean true if hitting, false if not

************************************
[48619] obj.hitTestPath(other, num, showPoints, returnPoints)

hitTestPath
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
See if the shape of an object is hitting points on a path of a Squiggle or Blob.
num is how many points between each point on the path we test - default is 2
SEE: https://zimjs.com/hittestpath.html

EXAMPLE
const path = new Blob().center();
const circle = new Circle(50, purple).pos(100,100).drag();
circle.on("pressmove", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (circle.hitTestPath(path, 3, true)) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.alpha -= .02;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
});

PARAMETERS
other - the path (Squiggle or Blob) to test to see if the object shape is hitting
num - (default 2) the number of points added to the path roughly between each point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this gets totalled - so num*numPoints and then distributed along the path
showPoints (default false) will draw small circles along the path where the hits will be tested
returnPoints (default false) set to true to return an array of {x,y} points that are hitting (or false)
returnPercent (default false) set to true to return a percent along the path the first hit occurs - unless overridden by returnPoints

RETURNS a Boolean true if hitting (or an array of {x,y} points if returnPoints is true), false if not


************************************
[48701] obj.hitTestGrid(width, height, cols, rows, x, y, offsetX, offsetY, spacingX, spacingY, local, type)

hitTestGrid
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Converts an x and y point to an index in a grid.
If you have a grid of rectangles, for instance, use this to find out which rectangle is beneath the cursor.
This technique will work faster than any of the other hit tests.

EXAMPLE
const tile = new Tile(new Rectangle(100,100),5,4,10,10).center();
const circle = new Circle(10,green).pos(10,10).drag();
circle.on("pressmove", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var index = tile.hitTestGrid(tile.width, tile.height, 5, 4, circle.x, circle.y,0,0,10,10);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(index);
});

PARAMETERS
width and height - the overall dimensions
cols and rows - how many of each (note it is cols and then rows)
x and y - where you are in the grid (eg. e.stageX and e.stageY)
offsetX and offsetY - (default 0) the distances the grid starts from the origin of the obj
spacingX and spacingY - (default 0) spacing between grid cells
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;null will be returned if x and y within spacing unless the type is set to "open"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spacing is only between the cells and is to be included in the width and height (but not outside the grid)
local - (default false) set to true to convert x and y to local values
type - (default index) which means the hitTestGrid returns the index of the cell beneath the x and y point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;starting with 0 at top left corner and counting columns along the row and then to the next row, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set type to "col" to return the column and "row" to return the row
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to "array" to return all three in an Array [index, col, row]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to "open" allow x and y to be in spacing and still return Array [index, col, row]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these will report depending on less than half the spacing or more than half the spacing between cells

RETURNS an index Number (or undefined) | col | row | an Array of [index, col, row]

animate
zim DisplayObject method
powered by createjs.Tween (TweenJS)

DESCRIPTION
Animate object properties in time (s).
You can set various types of easing like bounce, elastic, back, linear, sine, etc.
Handles callbacks, delays, loops, rewinds, relative, series and sequences of animations.
SEE: https://zimjs.com/animation

Shape Animation
ZIM animate() lets you animate one Squiggle to another or one Blob to another
See the props parameter under the convenience properties for shape and blobShift

Advanced Animation
ZIM animate() lets you animate along a path made with a zim Squiggle or Blob
These paths can be edited by the user and the animation will still work
The paths themselves can be animated or wiggled.
Orient and Flipping are available.
Dynamic speed can be set with percentSpeed and tied in to Accelerator and MotionController.
Scrubbing animation and path animation is also supported with percentComplete.
This can be used with a Slider, Dial, MotionController, Parallax or general coding.
Dragging along a path is as easy as setting the drag parameter to true.
This can be done with while animating or with the animation paused.
ZIM EXTRA! provides animation based on animation.
This allows for setting zoom, depth, speed, fade, etc. based on target y value while animating on a path
but EXTRA! also opens up endless possibilities as the input and output does not have to be the target.
This means that animation can also control properties of other objects.
SEE: https://zimjs.com/nio/

NOTE: to temporarily prevent animations from starting set ANIMATE to false
NOTE: see pauseAnimate(state, ids) and stopAnimate(ids) for controlling tweens when running
NOTE: set mouseEnabled of target before calling animate as animate itself sets mouseEnabled and then resets to original after a delay

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle(50, red)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.alp(0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.sca(0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.animate({alpha:1, scale:1}, .7, null, done);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
function done(target) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// target is circle if params is not set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;target.drag();
}

// or with ZIM DUO and from parameter:
const circle = new Circle(50, red)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.animate({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props:{alpha:0, scale:0},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time:.7,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from:true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});

// note: there was no need to set alpha and scale to 0 before the animation
// because from will animate from property values in props {alpha:0, scale:0}
// to the present set values - which are 1 and 1 for the default scale and alpha.
// This allows you to place everything how you want it to end up
// and then easily animate to this state.
// An extra advantage of this is that you can use the ANIMATE constant to skip animations while building
// See the https://zimjs.com/ornamate.html example

// RELATIVE animation
// rotate the rectangle 360 degrees from its current rotation
rectangle.animate({rotation:"360"});

// pulse circle
var circle = new Circle(50, red)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// pulse circle from scale 0 - 1 every second (use ZIM DUO)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.animate({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props:{scale:0},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time:.5,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
// toggle pause the circle when stage is pressed
S.on("stagemousedown", function() {

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function

props - the object literal holding properties and values to animate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic examples: {x:200} or {rotation:360, alpha:0} or {scale:4} or {x:300, y:300, scale:"2"} (relative scale)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are custom options below including Convenience, ZIM VEE, Relative, and Series properties.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** Before ZIM 7.1, this parameter was called obj - as to not conflict with CreateJS TweenJS props (now renamed cjsProps)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   obj is still available as a parameter name for backwards compatibility when using a ZIM DUO configuration object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONVENIENCE PROPERTIES
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scale - for scaleX and scaleY
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color - on ZIM shapes for setColorRange() and animate colorRange from 0-1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** this property cannot be run in a series - rather animate in a call function to accomplish a series of color changes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note - animate from one note to another when animating a ZIM Synth tone()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note ("A", "C2", "C#" or "Bf", etc.) is coverted to frequency
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shape - animate from one ZIM Squiggle to another or one ZIM Blob to another
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for now, the matching Sqiggle or Blob must have the same number of points
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to pause or stop a shape tween use the animate id parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blobShift - a number of points to shift the points of a Blob in clockwise direction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is when using a shape tween that is a Blob - can be negative
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;path - pass in a Blob or Squiggle to animate along path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://zimjs.com/nio/path.html
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the shape has lockControls set to false (the default) then the animation will be dynamic
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and adjust as the shape is changed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a set animation path is desired then set the shape's lockControls to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: Do not re-amimate an object that is being animated on a path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use a Container and animate the container on the path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and animate the object inside the container - otherwise percentComplete conflicts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;startPercent - (default 0) set to a percent for where to start the target animating
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZIM Bead objects will be given a startPercent that matches their start percentage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;currently not supported when dragging on path - it is very complicated
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;percent - (default 100) how much percent to animate from the startPercent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by default, the target will travel once along the path from its start position (startPercent)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can be less than the startPercent to make animation travel backwards on the path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the percent can also be bigger than 100 as well as less than 0
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so a percent:300 will travel three times along the path - and then rewind if rewind is set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a percent of -150 will travel one and half times backwards along the path from the startPercent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;currently not supported when dragging on path - it is very complicated
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;orient - an object with x and y to aim the target at
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://zimjs.com/nio/orient.html
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when a path is used this will default to rotate to orient to path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(for a Sprite, add the Sprite to a Container and animate the Container)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can set to false for no rotation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can set to any object with an x, y point such as a circle on the stage - or {x:0, y:0} or a new zim Point, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flip - default true when orient is true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;true will flip the object horizontally when its x direction goes negative
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://zimjs.com/nio/flip.html
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will also work with orient to make sure the target is not upside down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if object is pre-rotated then 90,-90,270 should work as ZIM will swap the the scaleX and scaleY
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but any unusual starting angles may not flip as desired - so put these in a Container and animate the container
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flipVertical - setting flipVertical to true will flip the object vertically when its y direction goes negative
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will also work with orient to make sure the target is not upside down

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EXTRA! - the following convenience properties are available for ZIM EXTRA! (also see extra below)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://zimjs.com/nio/extra.html
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zoom - an array that represents scale proportions based on target's y position
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[inputMin, inputMax, outputMin(default 0), outputMax(default H)] the outputs will be constrained to the provided values
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zoom:[.5,1.5] scales the target based on its y position - animating y or along a path will show scaling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zoom:10 - is like zoom:[0,10]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zoom:true - is like zoom:[0,1]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zoom:[1,3,H/2-100,H/2+200] would scale from 1 to 3 in this region and stay at 1 or 3 outside this region
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speed - an array that represents animation percentSpeed based on target's y position
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[inputMin, inputMax, outputMin(default 0), outputMax(default H)] the outputs will be constrained to the provided values
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speed:[20,100] sets percentSpeed based on target y position - animating y or along a path will have changing speed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speed:40 - is like speed:[0,40]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speed:true - is like speed:[0,100]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** will set dynamic property to true - as percentSpeed needs dynamic property set to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;layer - an array that represents ratio of layer proportions based on target's y position
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[inputMin, inputMax, outputMin(default 0), outputMax(default H)] the outputs will be constrained to the provided values
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;layer:[0,1] sets current layer based on target y position - animating y or along a path will have changing layers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;layer:1 - is like layer:[0,1]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;layer:true - is like layer:[0,target.parent.numChildren-1]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fade - an array that represents ratio of alpha based on target's y position
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[inputMin, inputMax, outputMin(default 0), outputMax(default H)] the outputs will be constrained to the provided values
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fade:[.5,1] sets current alpha based on target y position - animating y or along a path will have changing alpha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fade:1 - is like fade:[0,1]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fade:true - is like fade:[0,1]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fade:[0,1,H/2-100,H/2+200] - would change alpha in this y region
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extra - in addition to the convenience properties above, ZIM EXTRA! has a more general and complete format:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass in a single EXTRA! object or an array of EXTRA! objects: extra:{} or extra:[{},{},{}]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object has the following properties - all are optional except the outputProp which is required:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|ZIM VEE| - each object below optionally accepts a ZIM VEE value for Pick.choose() to pick randomly from
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inputObj - (default target) - the object with the input property - probably the animation target but could be any object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inputProp - (default "y") - a string of the property name for the input - "x", "rotation", etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inputMin - (default 0) - the minimum input value for the calculation - also see constrain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inputMax - (default W if x inputProp else H) - the maximum input value for the calculation - also see constrain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outputObj - (default target) - the object whose output property is being changed - probably the animation target but could be any object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outputProp - (default "scale") - a string of the property name of the output - "scale", "layer", "rotation", etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outputMin - (default 0) - the minimum output value for the calculation - also see constrain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outputMax - (default 1) - the maximum output value for the calculation - also see constrain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;factor - (default 1) setting factor to -1 will reverse the direction of the animation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outputRound - (default false) set to true to receive rounded output values
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constrain - (default true) constrain the output value to outputMin and outputMax
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to false to let values go beyond provided mins and maxes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is quite usual when a proportion is easily figured at a certain range
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and continued increase or decrease is desired outside the range - just turn constrain to false.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EXAMPLES:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extra:{outputProp:"scaleX"} would animate the scaleX of the target from 0-1 over the stage height
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extra:{outputObj:circle, outputProp:"alpha"} would animate the alpha of circle based on the animated target's y position
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extra:{inputObj:circle, inputProp:"x", inputMax:W, outputProp:"level"} would animate the target's child index as the circle's x goes across the screen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** in the last two examples, circle is a different object than the target of the animation - circle might be animating independently or based on a Slider value, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|ZIM VEE| - each props property value optionally accepts a ZIM VEE value for Pick.choose() to pick randomly from (except the EXTRA! properties which accept ZIM VEE values inside)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these will be picked again if the loopPick parameter is true (default false)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RELATIVE VALUES: you can pass in relative values by putting the numbers as strings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rotation:"360" will animate the rotation of the object 360 degrees from its current rotation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whereas rotation:360 will animate the rotation of the object to 360 degrees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DOT PROPERTIES: you can animate properties on properties using quotes:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is animate used as a function to animate a threejs mesh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animate(mesh, {"rotation.y":360*RAD}, 5000);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note that the from parameter is not currently supported with dot properties (difficult bug)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSS PROPERTIES: animate can animate CSS properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZIM's CreateJS 1.3.2 has the CreateJS CSS Pluging installed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the css parameter to true and see the CSS parameter for more details
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANIMATION SERIES: if you pass in an array for the props value, then this will run an animation series
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The array must hold animate configuration objects:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[{props:{scale:2}, time:1, rewind:true}, {target:different, props:{x:100}}, etc.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you run animate as a method on an object then this is the default object for the series
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you can specify a target to override the default
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By default, each animation runs after the other, but a negative wait can be set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. if wait:-1 is set on the third animation in the series it starts 1 second before the second animation ends
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The default time and tween are as provided in the main parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you can specify these to override the default
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The id of the main parameters is used for the whole series and cannot be overridden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The override parameter is set to false and cannot be overridden
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All other main parameters are available except rewind, sequence and from
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(rewind and from are available on the inner tweens - for sequence: the initial animation is considered)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You currently cannot nest animation series
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: if any of the series has a loop and loops forever (a loopCount of 0 or no loopCount)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then this will be the last of the series to run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: color cannot be animated in a series - rather animate in a call function to accomplish a series of color changes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: a sequence cannot be seriesed and a series cannot be sequenced
time - |ZIM VEE| (default 1) the time for the tween in seconds (also see ZIM TIME constant)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see also the rate parameter and property to dynamically change the time the animation takes (its speed)
ease - |ZIM VEE| (default "quadInOut") the equation type for easing ("bounceOut", "elasticIn", "backInOut", "linear", etc)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also ZIM preset eases: "snapIn", "snapOut", "snapInOut", "balisticIn", "balisticOut", "balisticInOut", "slowmoIn", "slowmoOut", "slowmoInOut"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** CUSTOM EASE: see https://zimjs.com/ease for custom ease which can be passed in here as a value like so:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ease:zimEase([.2,.4,.6,.8]) // would be linear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ease:zimEase([[1.45,-0.57,0.67,0.55], [0.34,0.44,1.43,-0.31]]) // is the same as "snapInOut"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// see the zimEase() function in the docs for the Code module
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see CreateJS easing: https://www.createjs.com/docs/tweenjs/classes/Ease.html
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see easeAmount and easeFrequency parameters to adjust certain eases like back and elastic
call - (default null) the function to call when the animation is done
params - (default target) a single parameter for the call function (eg. use object literal or array)
wait - |ZIM VEE| (default 0) seconds to wait before doing animation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be negative for series to start animation before previous animation ends
waitedCall - (default null) calls function after wait is done if there is a wait
waitedParams - (default target) parameters to send waitedCall function
loop - (default false) set to true to loop animation
loopCount - |ZIM VEE| (default 0) if loop is true how many times it will loop (0 is forever)
loopWait - |ZIM VEE| (default 0) seconds to wait before looping - will automatically set loop to true
loopCall - (default null) calls function after loop and loopWait (not including last loop)
loopParams - (default target) parameters to send loopCall function
loopWaitCall - (default null) calls function after at the start of loopWait
loopWaitParams - (default target) parameters to send loopWaitCall function
loopPick - (default false) remake any ZIM VEE (Pick) props for the next loop (thanks GSAP)
rewind - |ZIM VEE| (default false) set to true to rewind (reverse) animation (doubles animation time)
rewindWait - |ZIM VEE| (default 0) seconds to wait in the middle of the rewind
rewindCall - (default null) calls function at middle of rewind after rewindWait
rewindParams - (default target) parameters to send rewindCall function
rewindWaitCall - (default null) calls function at middle of rewind before rewindWait
rewindWaitParams - (default target) parameters to send rewindCall function
rewindTime - (default time) set the time in seconds for the rewind portion of an animation
rewindEase - (default null) overwrite the ease for the rewind direction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this assumes that In is at the start of the rewind and Out is at the end of the rewind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so setting rewindEase:"bounceOut" will bounce back at the start of the animation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note - setting ease:"bounceOut" will bounce at the end of the animation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this allows for a normal start with a bounce and then a normal start at rewind and a bounce

startCall - (default null) calls function at the start of actual animation and after any wait (and waitedCall)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is basically the same as the waitedCall but will also be called at the start of animation when there is no waitedCall
startParams - (default target) parameters to send startCall function
animateCall - (default null) calls function every animation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this runs an alternate Ticker so does not aversely affect animate without an animateCall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alternatively, can set events:true and capture an "animation" event - but that is only for animations on ZIM objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wherease animateCall will always be available
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for instance, if using the animate() function on object literals, HTML/CSS tags or threejs objects, etc.
animateParams - (default target) parameters to send animateCall function
sequence - (default 0) the delay time in seconds to run on children of a container or an array of target animations
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the addition of ZIM VEE object to the target, you must noPick the array
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for example, target = container or target = {noPick:[a,b,c]} and sequence = 1000
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would run the animation on the first child and then 1 second later, run the animation on the second child, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or in the case of the array, on element a and then 1 second later, element b, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the loop prop is true then sequenceCall below would activate for each loop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For an array, you must use the zim function with a target parameter - otherwise you can use the ZIM 4TH method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: a sequence cannot be seriesed and a series cannot be sequenced
sequenceCall - (default null) the function that will be called for each sequence animation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: the value of the sequenceCall parameter will be the object that just ended animation unless there is a sequenceParams value
sequenceParams - (default null) a parameter sent to the sequenceCall function
sequenceReverse - |ZIM VEE| (default false) set to true to sequence through container or array backwards
ticker - (default true) set to false to not use an automatic Ticker function
cjsProps - (default {override: true}) legacy - allows you to pass in CreateJS TweenJS configuration properties
css - (default false) set to true if there is no Frame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZIM's CreateJS 1.3.2 has the CreateJS CSS Pluging installed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But other CreateJS versions will need the plugin available here:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://d309knd7es5f10.cloudfront.net/CSSPlugin01.js
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add that at the top of your code in a script tag
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and at the top of the main script install:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;createjs.CSSPlugin.install();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;script&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// other versions of CreateJS need to import and install CSS Plugin
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// createjs.CSSPlugin.install();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// the property must be set before you can animate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zss("tagID").opacity = 1; // set this even if it is default
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animate(zid("tagID"), {opacity:0}, 2); // etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// for transform styles use:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zss("tagID").transform = "translate(20px, 30px)"; // set this even if it is default
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animate({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    target:zid("tagID"),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    props:{transform:"translate(100px, 150px)"},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    time:2,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    loop:true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    rewind:true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/script&gt;
protect - (default false) protects animation from being interrupted before finishing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless manually interrupted with stopAnimate()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protect is always true (regardless of parameter setting) if loop or rewind parameters are set
override - (default true) subesequent tweens of any type on object cancel all earlier tweens on object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to false to allow multiple tweens of same object
from - |ZIM VEE| (default false) set to true to animate from obj properties to the current properties set on target
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note that from is not supported with dot properties such as "rotation.x" with threejs (a difficult bug)
set - |ZIM VEE| (default null) an object of properties to set on the target to start (but after the wait time)
id - (default null) set to String to use with pauseAnimate(state, id) and stopAnimate(id) - thanks Sean Berwick for typo catch
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;series animate gets only one overall id - so no id per animation object
events - (default false) set to true to receive an "animation" event on the target (or Container with a Container sequence)
sequenceTarget - (default null) used internally for processing sequence animations
dynamic - (default false) set to true to turn on dynamic speed animation via the percentSpeed property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting perecentSpeed (default 100) will adjust the speed of the animation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to change speed with a Slider, Dial, MotionController, Accelerator, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use target.animate({props:{rotation:360}, dynamic:true, set:{percentSpeed:0}}); to start off with no animation
drag - (default false) used with path in props to drag along path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be done while animating or while the animation is paused
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting drag to true will set startPaused to true as well - set startPaused to false to animate and drag
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rewind set, drag lets you change the direction of an animation while animating
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To turn drag off use the pause() method that animate() adds to the target
clamp - (default true) used with dynamic and non-looping - set to false to let time pass beyond animation start and end
startPaused - (default false - true if drag is true) Boolean - set to true to start the animation in the paused state
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good for animating manually with the percentComplete property
clean - (default true) set to false to not delete animation ids etc. at end of animate()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could then use percentComplete to position tween and pauseTween(false) to start animating again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note... once tween has waited, percentComplete does not include wait period
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So clean cannot be used to restart an animation with a wait after the animation has waited
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the replayTween() method of the target to restart the latest animation on a target
obj - (depreciated) the old version of props - kept for backwards compatibility
seriesWait - (internal) used internally to hold setting relative values in correct series order
sequenceWait - (internal) used internally to tie sequence in to the animation chain for pauseAnimate and stopAnimate
rate - |ZIM VEE| - (default 1) change the speed at which the animation runs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to .5 to run at half the speed and 2 to run at twice the speed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a ZIM VEE here will update each loop if loopPick is set to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to change the speed (time) of the animation for each loop
pauseOnBlur - (default true) as of ZIM 10.8.0, animate defaults to pause all animations on blur
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blur is when the window is reduced or a different tab gains focus on the Browser
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animate uses requestAninationFrame which slows down when the window is not in focus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can cause animations to go out of sync - pauseOnBlur will prevent this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can also set zim.pauseAnimateOnBlur=false or true to change this at any time
easeAmount - |ZIM VEE| - (default null) set to change the tween effect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ease amounts are as follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quad (default 2) - exponent - this is the default ZIM tween
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cubic (default 3) - exponent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quart (default 4) - exponent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quint (default 5) - exponent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back (default 1.7) - strength
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elastic (default 1) - amplitude - also see easeFrequency
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;linear, bounce, circ, sin - no affect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: used mostly with back and elastic (backIn, backOut, backInOut, etc.)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as setting the tween to quadInOut and then easeAmount to 5
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would be the same as a quintInOut.
easeFrequency - |ZIM VEE| - (default .3 elasticIn and elasticOut or .3*1.5 elasticInOut)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to change the elastic ease frequency
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so tween:"elasticOut", easeFrequency:.2 is a faster elastic
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the time may also need to be increased or decreased as desired
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see easeAmount where easeAmount:3 would be a larger elastic
timeUnit - (default TIME) override the TIME setting to "seconds" / "s" or "milliseconds" / "ms"
timeCheck - (default true) set to false to not have animate() warn of potentially wrong time units - see also TIMECHECK
noAnimateCall - (default true) set to false to not call the callback function if ANIMATE is set to false

PROPERTIES - zim.animate() adds the following properties to any object it animates:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animating - read-only - true when animating (including when waiting)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see paused (the opposite) and waiting properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paused - read-only - when animating, paused is set to false
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When paused with pauseAnimate() then paused is set to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When stopped or before animation, paused is undefined or null
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one paused property per object so pausing a specific id
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on an object with multiple animations will set paused to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even if other animations are still running.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pausing multiple objects should work fine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the tweenState property to test which ids are animating or paused
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waiting - read-only - true when animation is waiting in wait, rewindWait, loopWait
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tweenState - an object with tween ids as properties along with an all property (unless no tweens anymore)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these properties are true if animating and false if paused
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if all is true then all are animating except for the ids that hold false
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if all is false then all are not animating except for the ids that hold true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is used for pauseAnimateOnBlur to keep track of animations to set back to true when un-blurring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;percentSpeed - get or set the percent of the animation speed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100% is regular time, 50% is half as fast, 200% is twice as fast -100% is reverse normal speed, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use target.animate({props:{rotation:360}, dynamic:true, set:{percentSpeed:0}}); to start off with no animation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rate - changes the speed of the animation with 1 as a ratio
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so 1 is the default speed (time), .5 would be half the speed, 2 twice the speed, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does what percentSpeed does by changing the CreateJS timeScale property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this does not require dynamic to be set and is probably more efficient
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;percentComplete - get or set percent complete (0-100)  **
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this allows you to scrub through an animation with a Slider, Dial, MotionController, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should probably set startPaused parameter of animate() to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting percentComplete to 100 may cause the animation to start at the beginning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but can set rewind:true and then set percentComplete to 50 - this will animate "backwards"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can use animation event and a test of percentComplete to stop animation at a percentage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see  https://zimjs.com/explore/squigglepart.html
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** NOTE: As of ZIM 015, percentComplete includes the wait time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and spans across all animations on the object including animation series.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A percentComplete has also been added to the CreateJS tweens for individual control.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The individual tweens can be found in the zimTweens object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the latestTween will give access to the latest tween runing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for setting percentComplete on an animation with a wait you can access the latestTween
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the waited call back function.

METHODS - see pauseAnimate() and stopAnimate() under the METHODS module
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also - zim.animate() adds a pause(state, time) method to the target IF dynamic is set to true (or drag is true)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This matches the pause() of Dynamo and Scroller and is used by Accelerator
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   state - (default true) true pauses and setting the state to false will unpause the dynamic animation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   time - (default 0) time in milliseconds to slow the animation down if pausing or speed it up if unpausing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endTween(callType) - stops the animation and sets the target to the properties at the end of the tween - returns target for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;callType defaults to "all" which will run the call function and all the call functions in a series
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting callType to "none" will not run the call function and not run any call function in a series
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting callType to "main" will run the call function but not the call functions in a series
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: any remaining rewindCall and loopCall functions will not be called when using endTween()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: endTween is complicated with ids, multiple animations, series, sequences, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if there is a problem, try adding the target to a Container and controlling separate animations on container and target
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resetTween() - sets the target back to the state at the start of the last animate() call - returns target for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: resetTween is complicated with ids, multiple animations, series, sequences, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if there is a problem, try adding the target to a Container and controlling separate animations on container and target
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replayTween() - resets and runs the last animate() on the target - calls the animate function with the same parameters as the last time - returns target for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: replayTween is complicated with ids, multiple animations, series, sequences, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if there is a problem, try adding the target to a Container and controlling separate animations on container and target
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if there is a series with more than one target then replayTween will only work on the main target
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instead, store the series in an object literal: const mySeries = {animation object} and call obj.animate(mySeries) and then later call it again obj.animate({mySeries})
EVENTS - zim animate() will add an "animation" event to the target IF the events parameter is set to true (default is false)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alternatively, see the animateCall and animateParams parameters of animate()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the "animation" event will be added to the Container for a sequence in a Container
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the "animation" event is added to the targets of an animation series
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If dynamic is set to true, will dispatch a "pause" event when animate is paused - could be delayed but time passed in to pause()

RETURNS the target for chaining (or null if no target is provided and run on zim with series)

[52027] obj.stopAnimate(ids, toEnd)

stopAnimate
zim function - and Display object function

DESCRIPTION
Stops tweens with the passed in id or array of ids.
If no id is passed then this will stop all tweens.
The id is set when using animate() or a Sprite id parameter.
An animation series will have the same id for all the animations inside.
To stop a Shape tween, set an id in the animate call and use that id to stop the shape tween
this is because the shape tween animation is not on the shape but on its many control points
See also pauseAnimate()

NOTE: formerly stopZimAnimate - which still works but is depreciated

NOTE: calling stopAnimate(id) stops tweens with this id on all objects
calling object.stopAnimate(id) stops tweens with this id on the target object

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// We have split the tween in two so we can control them individually
// Set an id parameter to stop or pause
// You can control multiple tweens at once by using the same id (the id is for a tween set)
// Note the override:true parameter
const rect = new Rectangle(200, 200, pink)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.centerReg()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.animate({obj:{scale:2}, time:2, loop:true, rewind:true, id:"scale"})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.animate({obj:{rotation:360}, time:4, loop:true, ease:"linear", override:false});
rect.cur("pointer");
rect.on("click", ()=&gt;{rect.stopAnimate()}); // will stop all tweens on rect
// OR
rect.on("click", ()=&gt;{rect.stopAnimate("scale");}); // will stop scaling tween

stopAnimate("scale") // will stop tweens with the scale id on all objects

stopAnimate(); // will stop all animations

PARAMETERS
ids - (default null) pass in an id or an array of ids specified in animate, move and Sprite
toEnd - (default false) set to true to call endTween() on targets to go to end of tween values
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warning: setting to true will make targets to go to the end of all their animations
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which could have the effect of ignoring ids for specific animations therefore stopping them as well

PROPERTIES
paused - zim.stopAnimate() will set paused property of stopped objects to null

RETURNS null if run as stopAnimate() or the obj if run as obj.stopAnimate()

MORE: http://zimjs.com/code/bits.html?title=stopAnimate


************************************
[52114] obj.pauseAnimate(state, ids)

pauseAnimate
zim function - and Display object function

DESCRIPTION
Pauses or unpauses tweens with the passed in id or array of ids.
If no id is passed then this will pause or unpause all tweens.
The id is set as a animate, move, Sprite parameter.
An animation series will have the same id for all the animations inside.
To pause a Shape tween, set an id in the animate call and use that id to pause the shape tween
this is because the shape tween animation is not on the shape but on its many control points
See also stopAnimate

NOTE: formerly pauseZimAnimate - which still works but is depreciated

NOTE: calling pauseAnimate(true, id) pauses tweens with this id on all objects
calling object.pauseAnimate(true, id) pauses tweens with this id on the target object

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle().center().animate({obj:{alpha:0}, loop:true, rewind:true});
circle.on("mousedown", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.pauseAnimate(!circle.paused);
});

EXAMPLE
// We have split the tween in two so we can control them individually
// Set an id parameter to stop or pause
// You can control multiple tweens at once by using the same id (the id is for a tween set)
// note the override:true parameter
const rect = new Rectangle(200, 200, pink)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.centerReg()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.animate({obj:{scale:2}, time:2, loop:true, rewind:true, id:"scale"})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.animate({obj:{rotation:360}, time:4, loop:true, ease:"linear", override:false});
rect.cur("pointer");
rect.on("click", ()=&gt;{rect.pauseAnimate()}); // will pause all tweens on rect
// OR
let paused = false;
rect.on("click", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paused = !paused;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rect.pauseAnimate(paused, "scale");
}); // will toggle the pausing of the scaling tween

pauseAnimate(false, "scale") // will unpause tweens with the scale id on all objects

pauseAnimate(); // will pause all animations

PARAMETERS
state - (default true) will pause tweens - set to false to unpause tweens
ids - (default null) pass in an id or an array of ids specified in animate, move and Sprite

PROPERTIES
paused - zim.stopAnimate() will set paused property of paused objects to the value of the state parameter

RETURNS null if run as pauseAnimate() or the obj if run as obj.pauseAnimate()


************************************
[52210] obj.wiggle(property, baseAmount, minAmount, maxAmount, minTime, maxTime, totalTime, type, ease, integer, id, startType, ticker, wait, pauseOnBlur)

wiggle
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Wiggles the property of the target object between a min and max amount to either side of the base amount
in a time between the min and max time.
Uses animate() so to pause or stop the wiggle use pauseAnimate and stopAnimate
either on the object or using an id that you pass in as a parameter

NOTE: calling pauseAnimate(true, id) pauses tweens with this id on all objects
calling target.pauseAnimate(true, id) pauses tweens with this id on the target object

EXAMPLE
const ball = new Circle().centerReg();
ball.wiggle("x", ball.x, 10, 100, .5, 1);
// wiggles the ball 10-100 pixels to the left and right of center taking .5-1 s each time

ball.pauseAnimate(); // will pause the wiggle

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function

NOTE: if using wiggle as a zim function the first parameter is:
target - the object to wiggle

property - the property name as a String that will be width-indicatorLength-edgeLeft-edgeRight
baseAmount - |ZIM VEE| the center amount for the wiggle - wiggle will go to each side of this center
minAmount - |ZIM VEE| the min amount to change to a side of center
maxAmount - |ZIM VEE| (default minAmount) the max amount to change to a side of center
minTime - |ZIM VEE| (default 1) the min time in seconds to go from one side to the other (also see ZIM TIME constant)
maxTime - |ZIM VEE| (default minTime) the max time in seconds to go from one side to the other (also see ZIM TIME constant)
totalTime - (default forever) the total time in seconds until a stopAnimate is called on wiggle (also see ZIM TIME constant)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adds a wiggleTimeout property to the wiggle target that holds the setTimeout id for cancelation of totalTime
type - (default "both") set to "positive" to wiggle only the positive side of the base or "negative" for negative side (or "both" for both)
ease - (default "quadInOut") the ease to apply to the animation
integer - (default false) tween to an integer value between min and max amounts
id - (default random id) the id to use for pauseAnimate() or stopAnimate()
startType - (default "both") set to "positive" to start wiggle in the positive side of the base or "negative" for negative side (or "both" for either)
ticker - (default true) set to false if wiggling a value other than a Display object property
wait - |ZIM VEE| - (default 0) time in seconds to wait between each wiggle - in addition to time set for wiggle
pauseOnBlur - (default true) as of ZIM 10.8.0, animate defaults to pause all animations on blur
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blur is when the window is reduced or a different tab gains focus on the Browser
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animate uses requestAninationFrame which slows down when the window is not in focus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can cause animations to go out of sync - pauseOnBlur will prevent this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can also set zim.pauseOnBlur=false or true to change this at any time

EVENTS
if totalTime is set, target will dispatch a wigglestop event when the wiggle stops

RETURNS target for chaining


************************************
[52329] obj.loop(call, reverse, interval, step, start, end, immediate)

loop
zim DisplayObject method
NOTE: overrides earlier loop function with added container loop
so that we can use earlier loop function without createjs

DESCRIPTION
The loop function (see the CODE module for loop) lets you loop through:
1. If you pass in a Number for obj then loop() does function call that many times
2. If you pass in an Array then loop() loops through the array
3. If you pass in an Object literal or ZIM Dictionary then loop() loops through the object
4. If you pass in an String then loop() loops through the letters
5. If you pass in an HTML NodeList or HTMLCollection then loop() loops through the tags

The loop method lets you loop through a Container
NOTE: you can also pass the container as the first parameter of the loop function

6. The loop method loops through all the children of the container
and does the function for each one passing the child, currentIndex, totalLoops, startIndex, endIndex, obj.
So this is like for(i=0; i&lt;obj; i++) {var child = obj.getChildAt(i);} loop
or for (var i in container.children) {var child = container.children[i];}

NOTE: If you pass in true for reverse, the loop is run backwards counting to 0 (by default)
NOTE: use return to act like a continue in a loop and go to the next loop
NOTE: use return NEXT when in interval mode to go immediately to the next interval - as opposed to return which goes to next but after another interval
NOTE: return a value to return out of the loop completely like a break (and return a result if desired)

EXAMPLE
var container = new Container().alp(.1).addTo();
// LOOP FUNCTION - for more examples see the CODE Module loop() function
loop(1000, i=&gt;{ // gets passed an index i, totalLoops 1000, startIndex 0, endIndex 999, obj 1000
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// make 1000 rectangles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Rectangle().loc(rand(W-100), rand(H-100), container);
});

// LOOP METHOD
// loop through children of the container
container.loop((child, i)=&gt;{ // gets passed the child, index, total, start, end and obj
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child.x += i*2;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child.y += i*2;
}, true); // true would reverse - so highest in stack to lowest, with i going from numChildren-1 to 0

EXAMPLE
// looping with the interval setting

// loop through an array every 1 second
loop(10, i=&gt;{zog(i);}, null, 1);

// loop through a Container every .01 seconds
const tile = new Tile(new Rectangle(26,26,[green, blue, pink]), 10, 10, -1, -1)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.reg(CENTER)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.pos(0,100,CENTER,BOTTOM)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.loop(item=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item.color = darker;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}, null, .01);

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
call - the function to call
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the function will receive (as its final parameters) the index, total, start, end, obj
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where the index is the current index, total is how many times the loop will run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;start is the start index, end is the end index and obj is the object passed to the loop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the starting parameters vary depending on the type of obj:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the obj is a number then the first parameter is the index (no extra starting parameters given)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the obj is an array then the first parameter is the element at the current index
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the obj is an object literal then the first and second parameters are the property name and property value at the current index
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the obj is a string then the first parameter is the letter at the current index
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the obj is a container then the first parameter is the child of the container at the current index
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the obj is an HTMLCollection then the first parameter is the tag
reverse - (default false) set to true to run the loop backwards to 0
interval - (default 0) set to a number of seconds between each loop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use return NEXT to go immediately to the next interval
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use return to just leave current interval then wait another interval to continue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return a value (other than NEXT) to exit the loop and clear the inverval
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the interval object is provided at the end of the loop function parameters - but will probably not be needed
step - (default 1) each step will increase by this amount (positive whole number - use reverse to go backwards)
start - (default 0 or length-1 for reverse) index to start
end - (default length-1 or 0 for reverse) index to end
immediate - (default true) set to false to not start the loop right away, but rather wait for a first interval

RETURNS any value returned from the loop - or true if no value is returned from a loop

[52638] obj.scaleTo(boundObj, percentX, percentY, type, boundsOnly, simple)

scaleTo
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Scales object to a percentage of another object's bounds and scale
Percentage is from 0 - 100 (not 0-1).
Also see sca(), fit() and Layout().

NOTE: currently supports rotated objects only for FIT mode and not for FILL or FULL.
For rotated objects in FILL or FULL, put the rotated object in a Container
and then scaleTo() the container

WARNING: an error is happening when using scaleTo() in a resize event in FULL mode.
Use the simple:true parameter to avoid errors - but may not work with rotated nested objects

EXAMPLE
circle.scaleTo(stage, 50); // scale to half the W
circle.scaleTo(stage, 10, 20); // fit within these scalings of the stage

PARAMETERS - supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
boundObj - the object that we are scaling to with percents below
percentX - (default no scaling) the scale in the x
percentY - (default no scaling) the scale in the y
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if both percentX and percentY are missing then assumes 100, 100 for each
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and type defaults to FILL rather than FIT
type - (default FIT or FILL if no percent is provided) the scaling to match bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: as of ZIM Cat 04 the constant FIT or the string "fit", etc. can be used
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: as of ZIM NFT the default is FILL if no percent and FIT if a percent is provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIT: to keep proportion (aspect ratio) and fit within bounds (formerly "smallest")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FILL: to keep proportion (aspect ratio) and fill the bounds (formerly "biggest")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FULL: match bounds dimensions - may stretch object (formerly "both" or "stretch")
boundsOnly - (default false) set to true to scale to the boundObj's bounds only - ignoring current boundObj scale
simple - (default false) set to true to avoid errors specifically in resize event

RETURNS obj for chaining

************************************
[52744] obj.fit(left, top, width, height, type)

fit
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Scale an object to rectangular dimensions and center it.
Actually scales and positions the object.
Object must have bounds set (setBounds()).

EXAMPLE
circle.fit(100, 100, 200, 300); // fits and centers in these dimensions

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
left, top, width, height - (default stage dimensions) the rectangle to fit
type - (default FIT) the scaling to match rectangle dimensions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: as of ZIM Cat 04 the constant FIT or the string "fit", etc. can be used
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIT: to keep proportion (aspect ratio) and fit within rectangle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FILL: to keep proportion (aspect ratio) and fill the rectangle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FULL: match rectange dimensions - may stretch object

RETURNS an Object literal with the new and old details (bX is rectangle x, etc.):
{x:obj.x, y:obj.y, width:newW, height:newH, scale:scale, scaleX:scaleX, scaleY:scaleY, bX:left, bY:top, bWidth:width, bHeight:height}

************************************
[52846] obj.boundsToGlobal(rect, flip, inside, globalObj)

boundsToGlobal
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Returns a createjs Rectangle of the bounds of object projected onto the stage.
Handles scaling and rotation.
If a createjs rectangle is passed in then it converts this rectangle
from within the frame of the obj to a global rectangle.
If flip (default false) is set to true it goes from global to local rect.
Used by drag() and hitTestBounds() above - probably you will not use this directly.

EXAMPLE
zog(circle.boundsToGlobal().x); // global x of circle

PARAMETERS
rect - (default null) a rect inside an object which you would like mapped to global
flip - (default false) make a global rect ported to local values
inside - (default false) [NOT WORKING YET] make a rectangle from smallest projection rather than largest
globalObj - (default stage) project rectangle into a Container other than the stage

RETURNS a createjs Rectangle of the bounds of object projected onto the stage


************************************
[52926] obj.resetBounds(width||boundsX, height||boundsY, null||width, null||height, margin)

resetBounds
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Pass in no parameters to reset the bounds to calculated bounds
Pass in width and height to set bounds to (0,0,width,height)
Pass in x, y, width and height to set bounds to (0,0,width,height)

NOTE: a container made with new Container() has auto calculated bounds
so the bounds (and width and height) adapt to surround any new children's bounds
A container set with bounds to start: new Container(100, 200) has static bounds
so the bounds (and width and height) will not change as new children are added
Calling container.resetBounds() with no parameter sets dynamic calculated bounds
Or you can reset the static bounds with parameters.

EXAMPLE
const container = new Container();
const rect = new Rectangle(500,300).addTo(container);
zog(container.width, container.height); // 500, 300 dynamic bounds

// OR

const container = new Container(100, 100);
const rect = new Rectangle(500,300).addTo(container);
zog(container.width, container.height); // 100, 100 static bounds

container.resetBounds();
zog(container.width, container.height); // 500, 300 dynamic bounds

container.resetBounds({margin:20});
zog(container.bounds); // -20, 20, 540, 340 static with margin

container.resetBounds(200, 200);
rect.removeFrom();
zog(container.width, container.height); // 200, 200 static bounds

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
width - (default null) null will set dynamic bounds and the object will take on bounds of children if a Container
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting a number for the width will set static bounds that do not change as objects are added
height - (default width) the height of the bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if there is a width supplied but no height then the height is set to the width
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting these run obj.setBounds(boundsX,boundsY,width,height);
OR if four parameters are set:
boundsX - (default 0) the x of the bounds
boundsY - (default 0) the y of the bounds
width - (default null) the width of the bounds
height - (default width) the height of the bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if there is a width supplied but no height then the height is set to the width
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting these run obj.setBounds(boundsX,boundsY,width,height);
margin - (default 0) add margin to increase (or decrease if negative) bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if used, this makes the bounds static rather than dynamic.

RETURNS object for chaining

[53010] obj.copyMatrix(source)

copyMatrix
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Copies the transformation properties from the source to the obj
(x, y, rotation, reg, scale and skew)

NOTE: used internally by animate() and setMask() for copying transform of shapes to mask
also used in addDisplayMembers for clone() method

EXAMPLE
circle.copyMatrix(circle2);
// circle will now match circle2 in x, y, rotation, scale and skew properties

PARAMETERS
source - object from which the transform properties are being copied

RETURNS obj for chaining


************************************
[53047] obj.duplicate(exact)

duplicate
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
clones the object but also any custom properties

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle();
circle.custom = 345;
const circle2 = circle.duplicate();
zog(circle2.custom); // 345

RETURNS cloned object with cloned custom properties


************************************
[53081] obj.expand(padding, paddingV, paddingRight, paddingBottom)

expand
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Adds a createjs hitArea to an object with an extra padding of padding.
Good for making mobile interaction better on labels, buttons, etc.

Note: this will make the whole object a hitArea so objects inside will not dispatch mouse events.
If that is required then use "holder" container that holds the expanded object
and put the other target object on top of the expanded object but inside the holder container.

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle(10, red)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.expand(); // makes hit area bigger
circle.on("click", ()=&gt;{zog("yes");});

PARAMETERS - accepts ZIM DUO - regular parameters or a single configuration object
** one parameter for all padding
** two parameters for left/right and top/bottom
** four parameters for left/top/right/bottom with any blank to receive default 20
padding - (default 20) how many pixels to expand bounds
paddingV - (default null) the vertical padding (making padding for horizontal)
paddingRight - (default null) the right padding - if set then padding parameter is the leftPadding
paddingBottom - (default null) the bottom padding - if set then paddingV parameter is the paddingTop

RETURNS obj for chaining

[53138] obj.setSwipe(swipe)

setSwipe
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Sets whether we want to swipe an object or not using ZIM Swipe.
Recursively sets children to same setting.

EXAMPLE
circle.setSwipe();

PARAMETERS
swipe - (default true) set to false to not swipe object

RETURNS obj for chaining


************************************
[53176] obj.setMask(mask, dynamic)

setMask
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
Specifies a mask for an object - the object can be any display object.
The mask can be a ZIM (or CreateJS) Shape or a ZIM Rectangle, Circle, Triangle or Blob.
Masking must be done with a Shape and the ZIM shapes are actually containers with Shape objects in them.
So setMask() takes care of all the arrangements and updates the mask when using the following ZIM features:
drag(), animate(), gesture(), transform() and using the Bezier curves, etc. with Blob.

NOTE: to skew and rotate a mask, put the mask in a Container - then skew the mask and rotate the container.
That works better with skew anyway as rotation of a skewed object changes the skew.

NOTE: a Bitmap can be used for masking using the ZIM AlphaEffect
See https://zimjs.com/docs.html?item=AlphaEffect

NOTE: the mask you pass in can still be seen but you can set its alpha to 0
just watch, if you want to interact with the mask it cannot have 0 alpha
unless you provide a hit area with expand() for instance (use 0 for padding)
You can also set the alpha to .01

NOTE: before ZIM 6.7.1, setMask could not be chained - but now it can

EXAMPLE
const rect = new Rectangle(200, 100, clear)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center();
var label = new Label("BIG", 200, null, white)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.setMask(rect);

NOTE: to drag something, the alpha cannot be 0
so we can use expand(rect, 0) to assign a hit area
then we can drag even if the alpha is 0 (or set the alpha to .01)

EXAMPLE
const label = new Label("BIG", 200, null, white).center();
const rect = new Rectangle(200, 100, black)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.expand(0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.alp(0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.drag();
label.setMask(rect);

NOTE: animate(), drag(), gesture() and transform() work specially with zim shapes to make this work
otherwise, if you want to reposition your mask then set the dynamic parameter to true
or use a zim.Shape() or createjs.Shape directly to avoid this issue

EXAMPLE
// masking with a Blob
const image = new Pic("pic.jpg").centerReg();
const blob = new Blob({color:faint}).center(); // this is draggable by default
image.setMask(blob);

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
mask - the object whose shape will be the mask
dynamic - (default false) set to true if mask is being moved
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blobs and shapes with drag(), transform(), gesture() and animate() will auto set dynamic to true if dynamic parameter is left empty
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting dynamic to false for these will remain with a setting of dynamic false and the mask will not move once set

NOTE: use obj.setMask(null) to clear the mask

RETURNS the object for chaining
Older versions returned the mask shape - the mask shape can now be accessed by obj.zimMask or mask.zimMask

[53302] obj.outline(color, size, boundsOnly)

outline
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
For testing purposes.
Draws a rectangle around the bounds of obj (adds rectangle to the objects parent).
Draws a cross at the origin of the object (0,0) where content will be placed.
Draws a circle at the registration point of the object (where it will be placed in its container).
These three things could be in completely different places ;-)

NOTE: warning - the outline is added to the object's container so this can affect the container's numChildren, etc.

NOTE: will not subsequently be resized unless called again in Ticker, pressmove event, etc.
ZIM could update this outline automatically in drag and animate
but since the outline() is used for testing, it is not a good idea to waste processing

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle(50, red);
circle.center();
// show registration and origin at center and bounding box around outside
circle.outline();

EXAMPLE
Dynamic Examples
const ball = new Circle().center().drag({removeTweens:false});
ball.on("mousedown", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ball.outline();
});
ball.on("pressmove", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ball.outline();
});
ball.animate({rotation:360}, 4);
Ticker.add(()=&gt;{ball.outline();});

EXAMPLE
// When applying outline() in a loop - loop in reverse
// as outlines are added to the object's container
const tile = new Tile(new Rectangle(), 5, 4, 10, 10).center();
tile.loop(item=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item.outline();
}, true); // reverse loop

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
color - (default brown) the color of the outline
size - (default 2) the stroke size of the outline
boundsOnly - (default false) set to true to see only rectangle bounds

PROPERTIES
adds a ZIMoutlineShape and ZIMoutlineShapeC to object
adds an outlineToggled read only property that is true if showing and false if not showing outline

METHODS
adds an outlineToggle(state) method to the object that toggles the outline when called
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or can pass in true to show outline or false to not show outline
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note - method does not update the stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns object for chaining

RETURNS the obj for chaining;

************************************
[53462] obj.blendmodes(time, basic)

blendmodes
zim DisplayObject method

DESCRIPTION
For testing purposes.
Cycles through blendmode (composite operation) settings.
Click the object to toggle the cycling.

SEE: ble() for modes and how to set the blendmode

EXAMPLE
new Rectangle(W, H, red).addTo();
new Circle(200, blue).blendmodes(); // will cycle through blend modes

PARAMETERS
time - (default 1) seconds to see each blendmode
basic - (default true) set to false to include extra compositions like source-over, destination-out, xor, etc.

RETURNS the obj for chaining;

[53517] STYLE and Style()

STYLE
zim constant and static Class

DESCRIPTION
STYLE can be used to set any parameter on a DisplayObject and many of the Controls.
For instance: Circle, Blob, Button, Pane, Bitmap, Sprite, Tile, Pen, Emitter, Scroller, etc.
These are applied at the time the objects are made.
They are cascading with each level overriding the previous level:

1. GENERAL: any style can be specified in general
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corner:30 will make all corners default to 30
2. TYPE: styles for object type can be set to override the general styles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Button:{corner:0} will make all button corners default to 0
3. GROUP: styles for a group can be set to override the type styles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;homePage:{corner:20} will make all objects of that group default to 20
4. OBJECT: styles applied as parameters to the object override all other styles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Button({corner:40}) will make this button have a corner of 40

See: https://zimjs.com/style.html for an example
And: https://zimjs.com/test/styles.html for Control Styles

NOTE: As of ZIM Cat, a Style class has been added with the static methods to manage styles
STYLE is an object so all of these are just a couple lines to make it easier to update the object.
These include methods such as clear(), add(), remember(), addType(), addGroup(), etc.
See the Style entry down below for a complete listing and description.

NOTE: As of ZIM Cat 03, Direct Object styles are supported - adding DisplayObjects to a type {} is no longer required.
STYLE = {Button:{width:500}} // will be automatically converted to STYLE = {type:{Button:{width:500}}}

NOTE: As of ZIM ZIM 01, Direct Group styles are supported - adding a group to a group {} is no longer required.
The group must start with a lowercase letter.
STYLE = {big:{width:500}} // will be automatically converted to STYLE = {group:{big:{width:500}}}

EXAMPLE
STYLE = {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corner:20,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;backgroundColor:pink,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type:{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Button:{width:{min:100, max:500}, corner:0, centerReg:true, move:{y:series(-150, -50, 50, 150)}},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dial:{add:true, x:800, y:600, backgroundColor:red, scale:2, outline:true},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pane:{corner:ignore, color:white, draggable:true, width:300, label:"HI!"},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ProgressBar:{add:true, x:200, y:600, barType:"rectangle", transform:true},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tabs:{add:true, x:100, y:100}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;group:{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;homePage:{corner:30}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}
new Button(); // will have a corner of 0 and be pink
new Button({group:"homePage"}); // will have a corner of 30 and be pink
new Button({corner:10, group:"homePage"}); // will have a corner of 10 and be pink
new Button({corner:"ignore"}) // will have a corner of its default 20 and be pink
new Button({style:false}).pos(700,100); // will have original default styles
new Dial(); // will be red and scaled twice as big and have an outline
new Tabs(); // will have a corner of 20 and selection will be pink
var p = new ProgressBar({corner:15}); // will be a bar with transform tools, corner 15
p.percent = 25;
new Pane().show(); // will ignore corner 30 and use its original 20 - it will say HI! in white and be draggable

EXAMPLE
// Lazy Objects - as of ZIM Cat 03
STYLE = {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circle:{color:red} // all circles made from now on are red
}
// This will be automatically converted by ZIM to:
STYLE = {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type:{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Circle:{color:red}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}

Style.add({Circle:{color:red}}); // Lazy Objects with Style would do the same
Style.addType("Circle",{color:red}); // the traditional Style way also works
new Circle(50).center();

EXAMPLE
// Lazy Groups - as of ZIM ZIM 01
// note: these must be lowercase so not confused with Lazy Objects
STYLE = {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert:{color:red} // all objects with group alert made from now on are red
}
// This will be automatically converted by ZIM to:
STYLE = {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;group:{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert:{color:red}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}

Style.add({alert:{color:red}}); // Lazy Groups with Style would do the same
Style.addGroup("alert",{color:red}); // the traditional Style way also works
new Circle({group:"alert"}).center();

EXAMPLE
// using once to run a STYLE on only the next object
STYLE = {color:red, once:true}
new Circle().center(); // this will be red
new Circle().center().mov(20); // this will be black

EXAMPLE
STYLE = {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;borderColor:dark,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;borderWidth:5,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rectangle:{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// color:red,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color:[red, pink, purple], // pick a random color from here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;centerReg:true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animate:{props:{rotation:360}, time:.5, ease:"linear", loop:true},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move:{x:series(-200, 0, 200)}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}
// make three spinning rectangles
loop(3, ()=&gt;{new Rectangle();});

EXAMPLE
// this makes all objects be cached at their width and height
STYLE = {cache:true}

// specify width and height for any Label
STYLE = {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Label:{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cache:{width:20, height:20} // or also pass in x and y
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}

EXAMPLE
// Note: these commands are on the Style class not STYLE - but they operate on STYLE
// Also remember that ZIM STYLE only gets applied to new objects
// changing a STYLE will not change objects already created - this is different than CSS

// add a general color red style overwriting any previous color setting
Style.add({color:red});

// remove the general style for color
Style.remove("color");

// add styles for a Dial - overwriting all previous Dial styles
Style.addType("Dial", {useTicks:false, backgroundColor:yellow});

// remember current style using a "default" id
Style.remember();

// new Dials will use ticks and not be yellow
Style.addType("Dial", {useTicks:true});

// bring back the remembered styles so new Dials will have no ticks and be yellow
Style.recall();

// remember current STYLE to an id
Style.remember("myID");

// add styles for a group (existing objects are not changed - new ones will be)
Style.addGroup("big", {size:100});

the STYLE at the time myID was remembered will be active from now on
Style.recall("myID");

TRANSFORM STYLES
Transformations can also be applied (all are numbers - visible is a Boolean):
x, y, rotation, alpha, scale, scaleX, scaleY, regX, regY, skewX, skewY, visible
a bounds style has a value of {x:Number, y:Number, width:Number, height:Number}
where x and y are optional

RANDOM, RANGES, AND SERIES STYLES
Any property value can be a ZIM VEE value to make use of ZIM Pick see https://zimjs.com/docs.html?item=Pick
color:[red, green, blue] will pick a random color for each object for which the style is applied
x:series(100,200,300) will place subsequent objects at these locations
width:{min:100, max:500} will make objects with a width within this range
corner:{noPick:[0,40,0,40]}; will set corners - note we have to noPick this otherwise it would pick a number from the array for the corner value
See Docs on ZIM Pick() and ZIM series() for more information
Use the delayPick:true style to pass a PICK object to a control
See: https://zimjs.com/explore/circleArcs.html
WARNING - if applying a ZIM VEE value for a property in the general style scope
it will be activated for every object made even if that object does not have that property.
This will affect a series for instance. If three Sliders with useLabels turned on are made
and the STYLE = {max:series(8,9,10)} this will not work as expected
as the labels trigger the series steps as well.
So use STYLE = {Slider:{max:series(8,9,10)}} instead so the series triggers only for Slider objects.

ONCE
Set a once property to true to run the STYLE setting on only the next object made.
Once will delete the STYLE after the next object is made
regardless of the whether the style is applied.
STYLE = {color:red, once:true}
new Circle().center(); // this will be red
new Circle().center().mov(20); // this will be black
Set a once property to a type such as "Label" and the STYLE will be cleared after a label has been made
Note: some objects like an Arrow is made from a Button which has a label so this sometimes can be tricky.
If it does not work, just turn the STYLE = {} or Style.clear() manually.

FUNCTION STYLES
The following functions have been added:
addTo, loc, pos, center, centerReg, reg, transform, drag, gesture,
tap, change, hold, outline, bounds, mov, animate, wiggle, expand and cache
Values of true will give default functionality for all but tap, change, mov, animate and wiggle
ZIM DUO configuration objects can be set as a value for any of these
example: drag:true;  or  drag:{onTop:false}
For animate and wiggle, [] can be put around multiple configuration objects
to wiggle in the x and y for instance or run multiple animate calls on the object
The tap, change and hold events are only what function to call - no extra parameters are available
They can be turned off with noTap, noChange and noHold styles.

CONVENIENCE STYLES
add:true - has been provided to add to the stage (use addTo for other containers)
move:{x:value, y:value} or move:x - mirrors the mov Function style (just adding the e)
pos: has corner convenience values: "left", "right", "top", "bottom", "rightbottom" or "bottomright", "center" and "centerReg"
blendMode:"difference", etc. see ble()
mouse:false - set the object to noMouse() - no point in ever setting this to true as true is the default
visible:false - visible false
style:false - will turn off all styles for the selector

EXCLUSION
A value of ignore can be used to exclude any earlier styles and return to the original default.
ignore is a ZIM global variable - if zns is true then use zim.ignore or just "ignore".
Setting style:false will exclude the object from all styles
All DisplayObjects have a style parameter (default true). Set to false to ignore styles.

GROUPS
All DisplayObjects have a group parameter.
This parameter accepts a string or a comma delimited string of multiple groups.
The group of components can then be targeted in the Group section of STYLE
or as of ZIM ZIM 01, just the Lazy Group can be used to put just the group name (must start with lowercase letter)
A group can contain just one component and act like an ID in CSS.

INHERIT
Objects can inherit styles from their parent
Eg. setting a color font property on List will pass that to Tabs which pass it to Button which passes it to Label
This was initially set up manually but a new inherit parameter was created for a better system
If any styles are not being applied as expected or as desired, let us know at https://zimjs.com/slack and we can adjust!
The inherit property on the Components can be used to pass an object literal of styles to the component directly as well

STYLES FOR CUSTOM CLASSES
EXAMPLE
// 1. collect parameters: style, group, inherit
// 2. after calling super constructor add these:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.type = "Classname";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.group = group;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var DS = style===false?{}:zim.getStyle(this.type, this.group, inherit);
// 3. collect parameters like so:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (radius==null) radius = DS.radius!=null?DS.radius:100; // where 100 is default
// 4. call styleTransforms at bottom of class:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (style!==false) zim.styleTransforms(this, DS);
// 5. use styles in your app code:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STYLE = {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classname:{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;radius:200
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

Style() - ZIM class
Style provides static methods (on the class directly) to make changes to STYLE
These are very small - the techniques are provided as a comparison
Note: these affect only new objects - objects already created will not be changed

Style.clear() - clears the STYLE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same as: STYLE = {};
Style.clearTypes() - clears the types
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same as: delete STYLE.types;
Style.clearGroups() - clears the groups
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same as: delete STYLE.groups
Style.remembered - property for holding remembered styles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same as: remembered = {};
Style.remember(id) - stores a copy of the current style in memory at an id or "default"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same as: remembered[id||"default"] = zim.copy(STYLE); // makes a copy and clones cloneable objects
Style.clearRemembered(id) - clears all remembered styles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same as: delete remembered[id||"default"];
Style.recall(id) - sets the current style to a remembered STYLE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same as: STYLE = remembered[id];
Style.add(obj) - adds general styles in form {newStile:val, newStyle2:value}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same as: STYLE.newStyle = val; STYLE.newStyle2 = val;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can also pass in Lazy Object style: Style.add({Object:{newStyle:value}});
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or use Style.addType() below
Style.addType(typeName, obj) - adds a type along with its styles - overwrites the same type
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same as: STYLE.type.typeName = obj;
Style.addGroup(groupName, obj) - adds a group along with its styles - overwrites the same group
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same as: STYLE.group.groupName = obj;
Style.remove(styleName) - removes a single general style specified as a string - same as delete STYLE.styleName
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same as: delete STYLE.styleName;
Style.removeType(typeName) - removes a type as string
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same as: delete STYLE.type.typeName
Style.removeGroup(groupName) - removes a group as a string
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same as: delete STYLE.group.groupName


************************************
[54139] PATH

PATH
zim global variable

DESCRIPTION
PATH is used by lazy-loaded assets (not using Frame assets parameter or loadAssets() method).
This will be set by default to the latest path parameter in Frame or in loadAssets().

NOTE: if an lazy-loaded asset has a path in it (as in a /) then the PATH will be ignored.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// inside a ZIM Frame where no assets or path are provided:
new Pic("image.png").center(); // will look in local directory
new Pic("images/image.png").center(); // will look in images/ directory

PATH = "assets/";
new Pic("image.png").center(); // will look in assets/ directory
new Pic("sound.mp3").play(); // will look in assets/ directory
new Pic("test/image.png").center(); // will look in test/ directory

EXAMPLE
// inside a ZIM Frame with assets parameter of "image.png" and path parameter of "assets/"
new Pic("image.png").center(); // will look in the assets/ directory
new Pic("other.png").center(); // will look in the assets/ directory

PATH = null;
new Pic("image.png").center(); // will look in assets/ directory
new Pic("other.png").center(); // will look in local directory

const load = F.loadAssets("test.png", "test/");
load.on("complete", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Pic("test.png").center(); // will look in test/ directory
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

new Pic("new.png").center(); // will look in test/ directory


************************************
[54185] TIME

TIME
zim global variable

DESCRIPTION
Set to "seconds" or "s" (default) or to "milliseconds" or "ms" to adjust how time is used in ZIM
This will affect all time input in functions such as:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animate()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wiggle()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timeout()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interval()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprite()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emitter()
and various minor settings in
Swiper(), Tip(), Pen(), Marquee(), Button(), ProgressBar(), Stepper(), Pages(), Accessibility(), Frame()

animate(), timeout() and interval()
also have a timeUnit parameter that will override the TIME setting

NOTE: before ZIM Cat, all time was in milliseconds.
As of ZIM Cat, time defaults to seconds.
This was primarily to make animation times a little simpler for coders, especially youth
It also matches the units of industry animate engines such as GreenSock
Once animate() was adjusted, it made sense to change globally
The one question was timeout and interval which is based on JS setTimeout and setInterval
The order of the parameters are already switched (and other features are added)
so a simpler time adds additional incentive to use ZIM timeout and interval

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// default time is in seconds
new Circle().center().animate({x:0}, 2); // in 2 seconds

TIME = "milliseconds"; // go back to ms as in pre ZIM Cat.
new Circle().center().animate({x:W}, 2000); // 2000 ms

new Circle().center().animate({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props:{y:0},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time:2, // back to 2 seconds because timeUnit override
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timeUnit:"seconds"
});


************************************
[54234] TIMECHECK

TIMECHECK
zim global variable

DESCRIPTION
Check to see if time is in right units - default false (false as of ZIM Cat 04)
logs a warning if ((TIME=="seconds" &amp;&amp; time&gt;10) || (TIME=="milliseconds" &amp;&amp; time&lt;9))
Set TIMECHECK = true to turn on check if desired
for instance when converting an old file to ZIM Cat and want to check for milliseconds

NOTE: as of ZIM Cat - time is in seconds rather than milliseconds
the TIMECHECK helps catch any conversion issues
See also the TIME constant if milliseconds is preferred

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// default time is in seconds
// setting TIMECHECK to true will test for any time over 10 as that may be ms

TIMECHECK = true;
new Circle().center().wiggle("x", 100,200, 2000, 4000); // will give warning in console about time not being in MS


************************************
[54263] DIR

DIR
zim global variable

DESCRIPTION
Sets the direction to "ltr" or "rtl" (left-to-right or right-to-left)
This means the using START and END constants will affect certain positions and alignments as follows:
For pos():
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal will be LEFT for START if DIR is "ltr" and RIGHT if DIR is "rtl"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal will be RIGHT for END if DIR is "ltr" and LEFT if DIR is "rtl"
For Label(), LabelLetters(), List()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;align will be LEFT for START if DIR is "ltr" and RIGHT if DIR is "rtl"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;align will be RIGHT for END if DIR is "ltr" and LEFT if DIR is "rtl"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for LabelLetters, lineAlign is affected rather than align

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
DIR = "rtl";
new Circle().pos(100,0,START,TOP); // will pos 100 from the right

EXAMPLE
DIR = "rtl";
new Label({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text:"Will this wind be so mighty as to lay low the mountains of the earth?",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;labelWidth:200,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;align:START
}).center(); // will align the text to the right and then center label


************************************
[54299] SEEDRAND

SEEDRAND
zim global variable

DESCRIPTION

WARNING - currently, this does not work - see seedRandom() in CODE module.

If set, the ZIM rand() function will be seeded with its value.
This means that rand() will repeat in order its random results.

See also the seed parameter of rand() to customize which rand() calls repeat.
See also SEEDRANDCOUNT to change the seed order - for instance set to 0 to start over.

This allows, for instance, a generative art piece to be the same for a certain user.
Or in conjunction with SEEDRANDCOUNT lets a player replay a same random game level.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
SEEDRAND = 20;
zog(rand(10,100)); // each time the app is run, this will be the same random number between 10 and 100
zog(rand(10,100)); // this will probably be a different random number than the first - but the same each time
zog(rand()); // and this will be the same random number between 0 and 1 not including 1.

EXAMPLE
// Remember the seed for a user with localStorage (like a cookie)
SEEDRAND = rand(100000000);
if (localStorage) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (localStorage.seed) SEEDRAND = localStorage.seed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else localStorage.seed = SEEDRAND;
}
new Circle(100, [red, green, blue]).center();

// the user will always have the same random color
// unless no localStorage or localStorage is cleared

SEEDRANDCOUNT = 0; // or SEEDRANDCOUNT--;
// below, will make another circle the same color as the first
new Circle(100, [red, green, blue]).center().mov(0,300);


************************************
[54347] SEEDRANDCOUNT

SEEDRANDCOUNT
zim global variable

DESCRIPTION

WARNING - currently, this does not work - see seedRandom() in CODE module.
but there is no equivilant to SEEDRANDOMCOUNT yet - we are working on it.

The current order number used for rand() if SEEDRAND is set or the rand() seedRand parameter is set
This starts at 0 and increases each time rand() is used internally or in the app.

See also SEEDRAND and the seed parameter of rand().

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
SEEDRAND = 10000;
zog(rand(100)); // a first random number
zog(rand(100)); // a second random number

SEEDRANDCOUNT = 0;
zog(rand(100)); // the first random number again
zog(rand(100)); // the second random number again

SEEDRANDCOUNT--;
zog(rand(100)); // the second random number again

SEEDRAND = null;
zog(rand(100)); // an unseeded random number

SEEDRAND = 10000; // same seed as before
zog(rand(100)); // a third random number (as SEEDRANDCOUNT was not changed)

SEEDRANDCOUNT = 1;
zog(rand(100)); // the second random number again (index 1)

SEEDRAND = 200;
zog(rand(100)); // a new random number but at index 2 as SEEDRANDCOUNT does NOT reset when SEEDRAND changes


************************************
[54393] ANIMATE

ANIMATE
zim global variable

DESCRIPTION
Set to false to stop animate() calls from working.
Handy for testing your app so you do not have to wait for animations every time!
To animate things in you can place everything in their final positions
and then set the "from" parameter to true to animate from starting positions
like x or y offstage, scale or alpha of 0, etc.
Then to avoid waiting for animations to complete, you can just set ANIMATE = false
and all your objects will be in their final locations and you don't wait for animations
When you are ready to run your animations for a final version, etc. just delete the line
or set ANIMATE to true.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
ANIMATE = false;
// without the line above, the circles will animate in
// we would have to wait for them every time we load the app
// sometimes animations are even longer and this can waste development time
// when we add the line above, the circles are on stage right away
// this is easier and safer than commenting out all your animations

const circle1 = new Circle(200, green);
circle1.center();
circle1.x -= 110;
circle1.animate({props:{alpha:0, scale:0}, time:.7, from:true});

const circle2 = new Circle(200, pink);
circle2.center();
circle2.x += 110;
circle2.animate({props:{alpha:0, scale:0}, time:.7, wait:.7, from:true});


************************************
[54434] OPTIMIZE

OPTIMIZE
zim global variable

DESCRIPTION
A setting that relates to how S.update() is used by the components.
Default is false which means some components will update the stage automatically:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Slider will update the stage so that you can see the knob slide;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the CheckBox and RadioButtons when checked will update the stage;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Tabs change button colors and then update the stage;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;closing of a Pane will update the stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Stepper also updates as does changing color of a button, label, etc.
However, concurrent S.update() calls can slow down mobile performance.
So if you are making content for mobile you should set OPTIMIZE = true;
Then you will have to S.update() in the change event handlers
but you were probably doing things in these events and updating anyway!
Just be careful - you might be testing a checkbox and it won't check...
So it takes some getting used to running in optimized mode.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// add this to the top of your script
OPTIMIZE = true;
const slider = new Slider();
slider.center();
// will not see the slider operate (aside from rolling over button)
// unless you call S.update() in the change event
slider.on("change", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// do your code
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update(); // now will see the slider operate
});

components affected by OPTIMIZE:
Label, Button, Checkbox, RadioButton, Pane, Stepper, Slider, Tabs

OPTIMIZE set to true also affects the ZIM Ticker
for functions like animate, drag, Scroller, Parallax
See zim.Ticker as you may have to set Ticker.update = true;


************************************
[54480] ACTIONEVENT

ACTIONEVENT
zim global variable

DESCRIPTION
a setting that specifies the event type to trigger many of the components
default is "mousedown" which is more responsive on mobile
setting the constant to anything else, will cause the components to use "click"

for instance, with the default settings, the following components will act on mousedown
CheckBox, RadioButtons, Pane, Stepper and Tabs

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// put this at the top of your code
ACTIONEVENT = "click";
new CheckBox().center();
// note it now operates on mouseup (click)
// the default ACTIONEVENT is mousedown


************************************
[54507] DEFAULTWIRE

DEFAULTWIRE
zim global variable

DESCRIPTION
The default setting for wire() and wired() source input type (the input parameter).
wire will usually be used to wire a component to a DisplayObject
and components usually have a currentValue or selectedIndex property that is changing in a change event, for instance

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// put this at the top of your code
DEFAULTWIRE = "selectedIndex";
const selector = new Selector(someTile).center();
new ColorPicker().center().wire(selector, "selectedIndex");

// the ColorPicker has a currentValue which would normally be the default for wire()
// but here we override this with the DEFAULTWIRE so the selectedIndex is used instead
// alternatively, the input parameter could be set to "selectedIndex"
// but perhaps there are many of these so the constant is provided for convenience


************************************
[54535] KEYFOCUS

KEYFOCUS
zim global variable

DESCRIPTION
A global variable that stores the DisplayObjects that will receive keyboard focus.
This is a system for all DisplayObjects with keyboard controls (set to active).
Eligible DisplayObjects are:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squiggle, Blob, Stepper, Slider, Dial, Tabs, ColorPicker, TextArea
The first eligible DisplayObject made will set KEYFOCUS to itself.
Anytime an eligible DisplayObject is used it sets KEYFOCUS to itself.
Eligable DisplayObjects have a keyFocus property that can be manually set.
There is only one DisplayObject with key focus
so setting removes key focus from the last key focused component.

NOTE: if tabbing from one component to the next is needed, consider using ZIM Accessibility()

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const slider = new Slider().center().mov(0, -100);
const stepper = new Stepper().center().mov(0, 100);
// arrows will control the slider as it is the first component made
// if the stepper is used then arrows will control the stepper
// if stepper.keyFocus = true is set to start then the stepper would have key control
// alternatively, KEYFOCUS = stepper; would give the stepper key control
// setting KEYFOCUS = null; would make no component have key control (until the component is pressed)


************************************
[54569] POSREG

POSREG
zim global variable

DESCRIPTION
A global variable that stores the desired setting for the reg parameter of pos()
pos() had traditionally positioned based on registration point
Now it defaults to position to the sides or the top and bottom
Setting POSREG = true; will make pos() default to positioning at the registration

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
POSREG = false; // default
new Rectangle().pos({x:10, right:true}); // will position right side 10 pixels from right

POSREG = true;
new Rectangle().pos({x:10, right:true}); // will position registration point 10 pixels from right


************************************
[54594] DRAGALL

DRAGALL
zim global variable

DESCRIPTION
A global variable that stores the desired setting for the all parameter of drag()
By default, drag() will drag individual items in a container (currentTarget = false)
This is handy to quickly drag a bunch of things.
But some developers are used to dragging the whole container by default.
Setting DRAGALL=true will change drag calls to default to the whole container (currentTarget = true)

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
DRAGALL = false; // default
containerOfMonsters.drag(); // will drag individual monsters

DRAGALL = true;
containerOfMonsters.drag(); // will drag all the monsters at once


************************************
[54620] MOBILE

MOBILE
zim global variable

NOTE: for making mobile apps - see https://zimjs.com/mobile.html
and the PWA entry in Docs https://zimjs.com/docs.html?item=PWA

NOTE: this is the MOBILE constant not the mobile() function.
The mobile function detects if your app is on mobile
If searching for mobile press GO to go find mobile()

DESCRIPTION
A global variable that overrides ZIM mobile()
There are a half-dozen settings in ZIM that use ZIM mobile() to adjust default parameters
and various interactions - some examples are:

Squiggle() / Blob()
// handleSize = mobile?20:10;
// some interactions with controls

Button()
// toggleEvent = mobile?"mousedown":"click";

transform()
// customCursors = mobile?false:true;
// handleSize = mobile?20:10;

Accessibility()
// application = mobile?false:true;

Emitter()
// cache = mobile?false:true;

VR()
// swiper = mobile?false:true;

These settings will follow the value set by setting:
MOBILE = false;
or
MOBILE = true;

The default setting for MOBILE is "default";
If left as default, then ZIM uses the results from mobile();

WARNING: setting MOBILE will result in that value being returned from mobile();
To get an actual value from mobile() set MOBILE = "default" and run mobile();

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
MOBILE = false;
new Squiggle().center();
// will have smaller desktop Bezier handles even on mobile
// but will also set the Ticker framerate to 60, etc.
// unless MOBILE, at some point, is set back to default:
MOBILE = "default";

MOBILE = true;
new Blob().center();
// will have bigger mobile Bezier handles even on desktop
// but will also set the Ticker framerate to 30, etc.
// unless MOBILE, at some point, is set back to default:
MOBILE = "default";


************************************
[54690] Ticker = {}

Ticker
zim static class

DESCRIPTION
A static class to let ZIM use a requestAnimationFrame with a single stage update.
Used by ZIM animate, drag, parallax, scrollers, etc. but any function can be added.
If a function has been added to the Ticker queue then it will run in the order added
along with a single stage update after all functions in queue have run.
There are settings that can adjust when the Ticker updates so see Usage notes below.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle(50, red);
circle.center();
Ticker.add(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.x++;
}, stage); // stage is optional - will be the first stage made if left out

// to be able to remove the function:
Ticker.add(tryMe, stage);
function tryMe() {circle.x++;}
Ticker.remove(tryMe);

// OR with function literal, use the return value
var tickerFunction = Ticker.add(()=&gt;{circle.x++;}, stage);
Ticker.remove(tickerFunction);

// Check to see if a function is in the Ticker for that stage:
zog(Ticker.has(tickerFunction)); // false at the moment until added again

USAGE
if OPTIMIZE is true then the Ticker will not update the stage (it will still run functions)
however, OPTIMIZE can be overridden as follows (or with the always() method):

METHODS (static)
** As of ZIM 5.1.0, stage is optional and will default to the stage of first Frame object made
** WARNING - if you are in a second Frame you should pass stage as a parameter so it does not point to the first Frame's stage
Ticker.always(stage) - overrides OPTIMIZE and always runs an update for the stage even with no function in queue
Ticker.alwaysOff(stage) - stops an always Ticker for a stage
Ticker.add(function, stage) - adds the function to the Ticker queue for a given stage and returns the function that was added
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the function will receive a CreateJS tick object with delta, time, timeStamp, etc. properties
Ticker.remove(function) - removes the function from the Ticker queue
Ticker.removeAll([stage]) - removes all functions from the Ticker queue (optionally per stage)
Ticker.isUpdating(stage) - returns true if Ticker is updating for the stage or false if not
Ticker.has(function, stage) - returns a Boolean true if function is currently added to the Ticker for the stage - or false if not currently added
Ticker.setFPS(60, 60) - (mobile, pc) default is set at natural requestAnimationFrame speed - this seems to be the smoothest
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: as of ZIM Cat 04, mobile default speed is 60fps - previous to ZIM Cat 04 mobile default speed was 30fps
Ticker.getFPS() - get the current frames per second - using createjs.Ticker.getMeasuredFPS();
Ticker.setTimingMode(mode) - (default "raf") RAF uses RequestAnimationFrame without framerate synching - gets screen synch (smooth) and background throttling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to "synched" for framerate synching - but will add some variance between updates
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to "timeout" for setTimeout synching to framerate - no screen synch or background throttling (if RAF is not supported falls back to this mode)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see CreateJS docs: http://www.createjs.com/docs/tweenjs/classes/Ticker.html
Ticker.raw(function) - a stand-alone direct call to RequestAnimationFrame for maximum speed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: https://zimjs.com/raw/
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does not use Dictionary lookup that the add() uses so provides ultimate speed for generative art, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returns function as id so can use Ticker.removeRaw(id)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function will receive a single parameter that is a DOMHighResTimeStamp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raw() does not automatically update the stage so put a S.update() in the function
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raw() is for when you want to run one function much like the draw() in Processing, the animate() renderer in ThreeJS, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add() is for when you want to run multiple functions with a single globally coordinated S.update()
Ticker.removeRaw(id) - remove the raw function based on the return value of the var id = Ticker.raw(function)
Ticker.dispose([stage]) - removes all functions from the queue removes and removes the list (optionally per stage)

PROPERTIES (static)
Ticker.update = true - overrides OPTIMIZE and forces an update if a function is in the queue
Ticker.update = false - forces no update regardless of OPTIMIZE
Ticker.update = null (default) - only updates if there is a function in queue and OPTIMIZE is false
Ticker.list - a ZIM Dictionary holding arrays with the functions in the Ticker queue for each stage
Ticker.list.objects - the array of stages in the Ticker
Ticker.list.values - the array holding an array of functions for each stage in the Ticker
Ticker.framerate - read only - use setFPS() to set

the Ticker is used internally by zim functions like animate(), drag(), wire(), Scroller(), Parallax()
you are welcome to add functions

USAGE
1. if you have your own ticker going, just set OPTIMIZE = true and don't worry about a thing
2. if you do not have your own ticker going but still want OPTIMIZE true to avoid components updating automatically,
then set OPTIMIZE = true and set Ticker.update = true
this will run a single update only when needed in zim Ticker for any zim functions
3. if you want a ticker with a single update going all the time (with OPTIMIZE true or false) then
run Ticker.always([stage]); // optionally per stage
4. if for some reason (can't think of any) you want no ticker updates for zim but want component updates
then set OPTIMIZE = false and then set Ticker.update = false
5. if you want maximum speed use Ticker.raw(function) which flows directly through to a RequestAnimationFrame


************************************
[55027] Pages(pages, transition, speed, transitionTable, holder, arrowDisableColor, style, group, inherit)

Pages
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Pages handle going between pages.
Make a Pages object and add it to the stage.
All your pages from then on are added to and manipulated inside the Pages object.
Pages allows you to set the destination pages for swipe events.
Other events like buttons can call the go(page, direction) method.
Consider using HotSpots() to efficiently handle multiple buttons.

ZIM Cat introduces the ZIM Page() class that makes a Container with a background Rectangle.
This can be used as a page or any Container or other DisplayObject can be used as a page.
Transitions with ZIM Emitter were also added in ZIM Cat.
See https://zimjs.com/cat/page.html

ZIM Cat 03 intruduces the ZIM Arrow() class for an easy previous/next button system.
See https://zimjs.com/survey.html

As of ZIM ZIM 02 a GlobalManager will be added to handle Pages resize for cached transitions.

NOTE: if you have a TextArea, Tag or Loader on a page, ZIM will automatically add and remove it.
but if the TextArea, Tag or Loader is in a Container on the page then it must be manually added and removed.
See https://zimjs.com/test/textareapages.html for an example

NOTE: if using a ZIM List in Pages then update the list after transitioning:
pages.on("pagetransitioned", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;list.update();
});

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// make pages (these can have content added to them)
const page1 = new Page(W, H, blue);
new Label("Swipe sideways").center(page1);
const page2 = new Page(W, H, green, pink); // makes a gradient
const page3 = new Page(W, H, yellow);

new Pages([page1, page2, page3], "slide").addTo();

EXAMPLE
// PAGES WITH ARROWS
const page1 = new Page(W, H, green);
const page2 = new Page(W, H, purple, pink);
const page3 = new Page(W, H, yellow);

const pages = new Pages([page1, page2, page3], "bubbleIM", 1).addTo();
new Arrow({pages:pages, direction:LEFT})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.rot(180)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.pos(50,50,LEFT,BOTTOM);
new Arrow({pages:pages}).pos(50,50,RIGHT,BOTTOM);

EXAMPLE
// CUSTOM SWIPING
const home = new Page(W, H, blue);
new Label("Swipe up and down").center(home);
const hide = new Page(W, H, green, pink);
const find = new Page(W, H, yellow);

// If swipe is not specified Pages will automatically swipe horizontally
// to the next page to the last page and backwards to the first page
// Here we override this with swipe arrays

const pages = new Pages({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pages:[
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// imagine pages to the left, right, up and down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// swipe:["to page on left", "to page on right", etc.s]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{page:home, swipe:[null,"info",hide,find]},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{page:hide, swipe:[null,null,null,home]},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{page:find, swipe:[null,null,home,null]}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transition:"slide",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speed:1 // slower than usual for demonstration
}).addTo();

// handle any events inserted into the swipe arrays
pages.on("info", function(){zog("info requested")});

// handle any custom requirements when arriving at a page
// the event gives you the page object
// so add a name properties just make it easier to manage
home.name = "home";
hide.name = "hide";
find.name = "find";
pages.on("page", function() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(pages.page.name); // now we know which page we are on
})

// you can manually go to pages as well
// we will make a little triangle to click:
var back = new Triangle({color:red});
back.center(find); // add triangle to find page
// not really supposed to add things to zim shapes
// they default to mouseChildren false
// we want to click on the back button
// so we have to set the mouseChildren of find to true
find.mouseChildren = true;
back.cur();
back.on("click", function() {pages.go(home, UP)});
S.update();

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
pages - (default null) an array of pages or page objects - for example:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[home, hide] assuming home and hide Page or Container objects are made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an optional swipe array holds mappings to swipe events [RIGHT, LEFT, DOWN, UP] or ["right", "left", "down", "up"]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these could be pages to the left, right, top and bottom of the current page
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or they can be call commands as strings that will dispatch events with that name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if no page has swipe data, then pages will swipe horizontally to each other by default with no wrap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if swipe data is desired then use page object format:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[{page:home, swipe:[null,"info",hide,find]},{page:hide, swipe:[null,null,null,home]}]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set swipe:[] to not swipe the page
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just setting one page with swipe:[] and leaving the rest blank, will mean no swiping
transition - (default "none") the type of transition "none", "reveal", "slide", "fade", "clear", "black", "white", "fan"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ZIM Emitter() can also be passed in as a transition.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the emitter has vertical or horizontal set to true then the emitter will sit above a slide transition
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise the emitter will sit above a fade transition.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following built in emitter transitions are provided:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"pixelDark", "pixelLight", "pixelZIM",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"bubbleDark", "bubbleLight", "bubbleZIM",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"lineDark", "lineLight", "lineZIM"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"explodeDark" "explodeLight" "explodeZIM"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: if using pages that are smaller than the sage, use a Rectangle() as the holder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the transition effects will be automatically masked by the rectangle.
speed - (default .2) speed in seconds of the transition if set (see also ZIM TIME constant)
transitionTable - (default none) an array to override general transitions with following format:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[[fromPage, toPage, "transition", seconds(optional)], etc.]
holder - (default the default stage) where are we putting the pages (used for setting transition properties)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If using pages that are smaller than the stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set the holder to a zim Rectangle with the desired dimensions and location
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the pages and transition effects will be masked by the shape of the rectangle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rectangle will have a mouse() added so it is interactive inside.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the color of the rectangle to clear if desired.
arrowDisableColor - (default grey) the disabled backgroundColor of the ZIM Arrow buttons
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when there is no next/prev page for that button
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to clear to hide the Arrow button completely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;false will not change the color but the button will not go anywhere when pressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
METHODS
addPage(page, swipeArray) - lets you alternatively add pages after you create the object
removePage(page) - lets you remove a page (if on this page, call a go() first and remove on the page event)
setSwipeArray(page, swipeArray) - lets you set the swipe array for a page
go(newPage, direction, trans, speed) - lets you go to a page for events other than swipe events
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;newPage can be a reference to the page or an index matching the pages array order
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;direction is which way the newPage is relative to the current page
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trans and speed are optional and will override any previously set transitions (speed in s)
resize() - call to resize transitions - not the pages themselves (use layouts)
pause() - pauses a transition before it starts (call from swipe event)
unpause() - unpauses a paused transition (unless another go() command is called)
puff(time) - adds all the pages behind the currentPage (adding time (s) will auto call settle)
settle() - removes all pages except the currentPage
setArrows(index) - disables or enables Arrow buttons held in arrows property - called automatically by Arrow buttons
disable() - stops swipe from activating and sets active = false
enable() - enables swipe action and sets active = true
dispose() - clears listeners and pages

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
speed - of transitions in seconds (see also ZIM TIME constant)
transitionTable - [[fromPage, toPage, "transition", seconds(optional)], etc.] overrides default transition
page - the current page object (read)
index - the index of the current page in pages (read)
pages - the page array - in format: [{page:page1, swipe:[leftPage, rightPage, upPage, downPage]},{page:page2, swipe:[leftPage, rightPage, upPage, downPage]}]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this may be adjusted if just an array of pages is passed which creates default swipe array
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will be adjusted for pages added or removed with addPage or removePage methods&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
lastPage - the last page before transition (read)
direction - direction of transition (read)
transitioning - read only Boolean as to whether the pages are transitioning
arrows - object with LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, UP properties each holding an array of ZIM Arrow buttons if created
arrowDisableColor - the disable color of the Arrow buttons if created
active - default true, boolean to have swipes active (good for layered Pages objects)
swipe - the ZIM Swipe object used for pages (can tweak distance to percentage if rescaling)

ALSO: see ZIM Container for properties such as:
width, height, widthOnly, heightOnly, draggable, level, depth, group
blendMode, hue, saturation, brightness, contrast, etc.

ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container properties, such as:
x, y, rotation, scaleX, scaleY, regX, regY, skewX, skewY,
alpha, cursor, shadow, name, mouseChildren, mouseEnabled, parent, numChildren, etc.

EVENTS
Pages dispatches a "page" event when the page changes (to a page in the swipe array)
myPages.on("page",function(e){...})
with myPages.page being set to the new page (e.target.page)
and myPages.lastPage being set to the old page (e.target.lastPage)
myPages.direction gets the direction of the transition (e.target.direction)

if there is a string in the swipe array like "info"
then the Pages() object dispatches an event equivalent to the string
for the data example above, myPages.on("info",function(e){...});
would trigger when the home page is swiped to the left

Pages dispatches a "swipe" event before changing pages if swiped
you can then get pages.page, pages.nextPage and pages.direction
you can pause() if needed the transition to handle data, etc. and then unpause()
you do not need to handle going to another page when swiping - that is handled automatically
so you probably will not use the swipe event unless handling data between pages

Pages also dispatches a "pagetransitioned" event when a transition is complete
you will have the same properties available as with the page event

USAGE
the first page object is the start page
for the data above, swiping the home page down automatically goes to the hide page
if the home page is swiped up it automatically goes to the find page
you can add pages with the addPage() method
it will not show until you swipe or go to it - unless it was the first page added
1. if the holder is the stage then add the pages object to the stage
2. if the holder is another container then add pages object to the holder
and add the holder to the stage (read this twice to make sure you got it!)
in the second case, you will have to mask the holder so you do not see transitions
DO NOT add the pages to the stage or holder - let Pages do it for you
sometimes you need a page to be on the stage to operate on it
if this is the case, call puff() and make adjustments
call settle() when done - or pass in a time in ms to puff to auto settle after that time
you can define multiple pages objects add and remove pages objects as needed

************************************
[55853] Arrow(backgroundColor, rollBackgroundColor, pages, direction, type, newPage, trans, speed, style, group, inherit)

Arrow
zim class - extends a zim.Button which extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Makes an Button with an arrow backing of different designs - see types parameter - default is a Triangle.
By default it faces right - you can use .rot(180) to make it face left and .rot(-90) or .rot(90) for up and down.

WITH ZIM PAGES
If you pass in a ZIM Pages object then the Arrow is set to automatically go from page to page.
You must pass in a pages object to use and which direction you want to go.
The button will call the Pages go() method for whatever page listed in the pages array at the current page and direction
In other words, if page is page1 and the pages array says page1 swipes right to page2
then passing in RIGHT would make pressing the Arrow button to to page2.
The order of the pages in the pages pages array may be different than their swipe targets
although if just an array of pages is passed into Pages then the order will match.

If a page has no page listed for the direction then the Arrow will automatically remove itself.
This means that PageArrow for a direction will be registered with the Pages object
So that the button can be added back again if a new page needs it.

These can be embedded on the pages themselves or used in interface outside the pages.

SEE https://zimjs.com/survey for an example.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// a fat arrow with a stick - also "thin", "angle" (no stick) and "triangle" (default)
new Arrow({type:"thick"}).pos(30,30,RIGHT,BOTTOM).tap(next);

EXAMPLE
// Assuming a pages variable that points to a ZIM Pages object
// These will go through the pages in order
// and default to remove themselves if not needed at start or end

new Arrow(blue, green, pages, RIGHT).pos(30,30,RIGHT,BOTTOM);
new Arrow(blue, green, pages, LEFT).pos(30,30,LEFT,BOTTOM);

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
backgroundColor - (default blue) the background color of the arrow (can STYLE anything Button style)
rollBackgroundColor - (default blue.lighten(.2)) the rollBackground color of the arrow
pages - (default null) a ZIM Pages object - if null then this is just an arrow button
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if set to Pages object then will atomatically work to change pages - see also direction
direction - (default RIGHT) a direction RIGHT, LEFT, UP, DOWN to the page the button will lead to
type - (default "triangle") the type of the arrow as follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"triangle" is a triangle (default)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"thick" is a fat arrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"thin" is a thin arrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"angle" is an angle bracket
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are icons and rollIcons added to a ZIM Button with clear backgroundColor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can also set backing and rollBacking properties, etc. with STYLE
newPage - (default null) specify a new page
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by default the page will go to the next page if direction is RIGHT or DOWN
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by default the page will go to the prev page if direction is LEFT or UP
trans - (default Pages default transition) the type of transition "none", "reveal", "slide", "fade", "clear", "black", "white", "fan"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ZIM Emitter() can also be passed in as a transition.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the emitter has vertical or horizontal set to true then the emitter will sit above a slide transition
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise the emitter will sit above a fade transition.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following built in emitter transitions are provided:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"pixelDark", "pixelLight", "pixelZIM",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"bubbleDark", "bubbleLight", "bubbleZIM",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"lineDark", "lineLight", "lineZIM"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"explodeDark" "explodeLight" "explodeZIM"
speed - (default Pages default speed) speed in seconds of the transition if set
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
activate(state, offColor) - turn on or off the Arrow button with state true or false and a color for offColor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns object for chaining
All ZIM Button methods

PROPERTIES
setDisabled - set to true or false in ZIM Pages "page" event function to override Arrow button setting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or just manually adjust the Pages pages swipe array - which is better as disables or enables swipe and Arrow button setting
All ZIM Button properties

ACTIONEVENT
This component is affected by the general ACTIONEVENT setting
The default is "mousedown" - if set to something else the component will act on click (press)

EVENTS
Arrow automatically adds a "mousedown" or "click" event to go to the desired page
The event will call the go() method of ZIM Pages
Additional "mousedown", "click" or other button events can be added if desired


************************************
[56071] HotSpots(spots, local, mouseDowns)

HotSpots
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
HotSpots allow you to create multiple hotSpot objects on multiple pages.
A hotSpot is an invisible click area (like an image map in HTML).
You can alternatively specify an object and it will turn that into a hotSpot.
HotSpots lets you control many or all of your interactions in one place.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// our first hotSpot will be a 50 pixel square at 100, 100
// then we will add hotSpots to these items as well
var circle = new Circle(60, red);
circle.center();

const button = new Button();
S.addChild(button);
button.x = W - button.width - 100;
button.y = H - button.height - 100;

// make the hotSpots object
// these are all on the same page
// gets really handy when you have multiple pages with Pages
const hs = new HotSpots([
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{page:stage, rect:[100,100,50,50], call:()=&gt;{zog("hot!");}},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{page:stage, rect:circle, call:()=&gt;{zog("circle!");}},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{page:stage, rect:button, call:()=&gt;{zog("button!");}},
]);
// hs.show(); // uncomment this to see rectangle hotSpots
S.update();

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
spots (default null) - an array of hotspot data objects with the following format:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[{page:home, rect:[190,50,260,260], talk:"screen reader content", call:someFunction, callOver:optionalFunction, callOut:optionalFunction},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {page:home, rect:[70,405,500,150], talk:"screen reader content", call:someOtherFunction, callOver:optionalFunction, callOut:optionalFunction}]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the page should be a Container
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rect is the [left, right, width, height] of a rectangle relative to the stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;talk (optional) will provide text for screen reader if ZIM Accessibility() is turned on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call is the callback function to call when a hotSpot is clicked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;callOver and callOut will add mouseover and mouseout event functions to the hotSpot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instead of a rect array you can pass an object that must have setBounds() set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[{page:home, rect:submitButton, call:function(){//code}}]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hotSpot will then use the button position and bounds as the rectangle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note - in this case, HotSpots will actually add a mousedown or click event to the button
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;null can be left here and then hotSpots added with add()
local (default true) hotSpot rect is based on local coordinates of the container
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use when the element scale independently from the stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if set to false then you pass in global coordinates and hotSpot will convert them
mouseDowns (default false) stops mousedown events on a button that is used as a hotSpot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prevents users from activating a swipe on a button (when using ZIM Swipe)

METHODS
show() - shows the hotspots for testing during authoring time
hide() - hides the hotspots
add(page,rect,call) - can dynamically add hotSpots
remove(page,rect) - rect is optional - so can remove all spots on a page or by the rect
dispose() - removes listeners

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
hotSpots - an array of HotSpot objects

ACTIONEVENT
This component is affected by the general ACTIONEVENT setting
The default is "mousedown" - if set to something else the component will act on click (press)

NOTE: the class does actually add rectangle shapes to your page
the spot is a pixel rect with an alpha of .01 and then uses a hitArea of a backing shape
this could have been done with "math" alone but rollover cursor would be a pain
the class creates HotSpot objects - see the class underneath this one


************************************
[56283] HotSpot(obj, x, y, width, height, call, callOver, callOut, local, talk)

HotSpot
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
HotSpot adds an invisible button to a container object (often think of this as the page).
If you want multiple spots it is more efficient to use the HotSpots class above
which manages multiple HotSpot objects (otherwise you end up with multiple event functions).
The spot is a pixel rect with an alpha of .01 and then uses a hitArea of a backing shape.
The spot will get a cursor of "pointer".

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const hs = new HotSpot(stage, 100, 100, 50, 50, myFunction);
function myFunction() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog("activation!");
}
// hs.show(); // uncomment this to see rectangle hotSpot
S.update();

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
holder - container object in which to place the hotspot (stage for instance)
x, y, width and height - of the rectangle for the hotspot
call - the function to call when the spot is pressed
local - (default true) hotSpot rect is based on local coordinates of the container
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use when the element scale independently from the stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if set to false then you pass in global coordinates and hotSpot will convert them
talk - (default "hotspot") text for ZIM Accessibility screen reader

METHODS
show() - helps when creating the spot to see where it is
hide() - hides the hotspot
dispose() - removes the listener and the spot

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
spot - the actual hotSpot object that gets added to the container can be accessed with the spot property
eg. hs.spot

ACTIONEVENT
This component is affected by the general ACTIONEVENT setting
The default is "mousedown" - if set to something else the component will act on click (press)

[56402] Guide(obj, vertical, pixels, hideKey, pixelKey, style, group, inherit)

Guide Class
<span class="extends">extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container
</span>

DESCRIPTION
Guide shows a guideline to help layout assets with code.
Cursor x and y in pixels or percentage are shown along edges
as a distance from the guide.
You only need one guide per axis because you measure from the guide to your cursor.
Use the G key to toggle guide visibility.
Use the P key to toggle pixels and percent.
Make sure you remove the guide for your final version (dispose).

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// simple form for a vertical guide
// use the distance from the guide to your cursor to measure
// so you only need one vertical guide for horizontal measurement
const guide = new Guide();

// better to add guides to a GuideManager
const manager = new GuideManager();
manager.add(new Guide(stage));
manager.add(new Guide(stage, false));

// or with percent
// manager.add(new Guide(stage, true, false));
// manager.add(new Guide(stage, false, false));

// then you can remove all guides with
// manager.dispose();
// handy with guides on multiple Pages

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alternatively, pass in true to show controls or false to hide controls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note - method does not update the stage
dispose() - removes keyboard event listeners and guide

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
toggled - boolean - read only true if controls are showing or false if controls are hidden
pixels - boolean - set to true to change to pixels, false to go to percent

[57085] Wrapper(items, width, spacingH, spacingV, wrapperType, align, valign, alignInner, valignInner, flip, reverse, bottomFull, colSize, rowSize, height, minSpreadNum, minStretchNum, percentVoidH, offsetVoidH, percentVoidV, offsetVoidV, style, group, inherit)

Wrapper
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
A Wrapper wraps its content to the next row at a given width
The Wrapper is similar to the CSS Flexbox with the following:

ALIGNMENTS:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has left, center/middle right then top, center/middle bottom alignments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for whole rows and columns and then for inside the rows and columns.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These may or may not be active depending on the wrapper type below
WRAPPER TYPES:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The types are spacing (default), spread, stretch, or column
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A colSize is available for the column type
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rowSize is available that works with any of the above types
SETTINGS:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also flip, reverse, bottomFull and col/row void settings.
MARGINS:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZIM display objects can have margins left, top, right, bottom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that will shift objects relatively inside the Wrapper
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without affecting other objects in the wrapper.

WRAPPER WITH WINDOW AND LAYOUT
The Wrapper is resized automatically when added to a ZIM Window.
Set the Window resizeHandle parameter to true to let the user resize.
The Wrapper resizes and scales as a region in the ZIM Layout class.
The Window also resizes - so a Wrapper can go in a Window in a Layout object.

WRAPPER VS TILE
The Tile is locked in to rows and columns and does not wrap content
The Tile also has many responsive settings to squeeze, stretch, align, etc.
Consider the Wrapper like FlexBox perhaps Grid with ColSize set - and the Tile like a Table

WRAPPER VS LABEL
The Label can wrap text using the labelWidth/lineWidth parameters (they are the same).
The Wrapper is used to wrap objects - perhaps including a Label object.

See https://zimjs.com/ten/wrapper.html

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const circles = [];
loop(40, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circles.push(new Circle(20, [orange, green, blue]));
});
const wrapper = new Wrapper(circles, 400, 20, 20).center();

interval(.5, ()=&gt;{

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;height:400,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;titleBar:"Wrapper",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;titleBarBackgroundColor:yellow,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spacingH:10,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spacingV:10,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrapperType:"spread"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}));

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
items - (default null) - an Array of items (or a single item) to add to the wrapper - also see add() addAt() and remove() methods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wrapper is a ZIM Container so any ZIM add and remove methods can be used and then a resize() method called
width - |ZIM VEE| - (default 300) set to a width to wrap items at this width (see resize(w,h) method to change width)
spacingH - (default 0) a spacing between items - ignored if colSize is set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spacingH does not get ZIM VEE - the results are jiggly when wrapping
spacingV - |ZIM VEE| - (default 0) a spacing between rows - ignored if rowSize is set
wrapperType - (default "spacing") changes how the wrapper lays out the items as follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"spacing" - places each item spaced at the spacingH from the next item
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"spread" - places equal spacing around edges and items horizontally (min the spacingH)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"stretch" - places equal spacing between objects horizontally with no spacing at edges (min the spacingH)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"column" - uses colSize parameter to determine spacing (spacingH is ignored)
align - |ZIM VEE| (default LEFT) set to CENTER, MIDDLE, RIGHT
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this aligns the whole row - see also alignInner for aligning inside columns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;align:series(LEFT, RIGHT) will toggle rows aligning left and right
valign - |ZIM VEE| (default TOP) set to CENTER, MIDDLE, BOTTOM
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this aligns the rows at the top, middle or bottom only when a height is provided (rare)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see also valignInner for vertical aligning within rows (common)
alignInner - |ZIM VEE| (default LEFT) set to CENTER, MIDDLE, RIGHT
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aligns the items when colSize is set only - see also align for aligning whole rows horizontally
valignInner - |ZIM VEE| (default BOTTOM) set to TOP, CENTER, MIDDLE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aligns the items in vertically in their row (common) - see also valign for aligning whole rows vertically (rare)
flip - |ZIM VEE| (default false) set to true to flip the order of the rows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flip:series(false, true) would read left to right then right to left then left to right, etc.
reverse - |ZIM VEE| (default false) set to true to reverse all the items so the first is (probably) at the bottom right
bottomFull - |ZIM VEE| (default false) set to true to fill the Wrapper at the bottom
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does not reverse but rather leaves potentially fewer items at the top
colSize - |ZIM VEE| (default null) set to number to hard code column width
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is ignored if the wrapperType is not set to "column"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use colSize:series(100, 200, 100, 400) to set specific sizes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will also the only setting for which alignInner works
rowSize - |ZIM VEE| (default null) set to number to hard code row height
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this ignores spacingV but can be used with any wrapperType
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use a series(100, 200, 100, 400) to set specific sizes
height - (default null) does not really set the height of the wrapper
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the height is always determined by the width and the items as they wrap
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(both the width and height cannot be used together without scaling and the wrapper does not scale items)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the height will have no effect when the valign parameter is set to TOP (default)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The height will place the bottom of the wrapper at the height when the valign is BOTTOM
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The height will place the wrapper in the middle of the height when the valign is CENTER/MIDDLE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: in the all cases the bounds will still be the bounds around the wrapper
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just the positioning of the wrapper is changed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows the wrapper to be placed at the bottom and grow to the top
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or placed in the middle and grow from the middle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which would not be possible otherwise aside from repositioning after each resize
minSpreadNum - (default 2) spread would always center a single item on a row
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and can look weird spreading two or even three final items
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a wrapper with wrapperType:"spread" will spread items if there are at least minSpreadNum items
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if there is less than minSpreadItems then it will align the items according to align
minStretchNum - (default 3) stretch would always center a single item on a row
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and can look weird stretching two or even three final items
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a wrapper with wrapperType:"stretch" will stretch items if there are at least minStretchNum items
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if there is less than minStretchItems then it will align the items according to align
percentVoidH - |ZIM VEE| - (default 0) set a percent horizontal space between items default in center
offsetVoidH - |ZIM VEE| - (default 0) set a percent (or negative percent) to offset the void from the center horizontally
percentVoidV - |ZIM VEE| - (default 0) set a percent vertical space between rows default in center
offsetVoidV - |ZIM VEE| - (default 0) set a percent (or negative percent) to offset the void from the center vertically
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
add(items) - add an item or an array of items to the wrapper - will call a resize() - returns the wrapper for chaining
addAt(items, index) - insert an item or an array of items at an index - will call a resize() - returns the wrapper for chaining
remove(items) - removes an item or items (pass in an array) - will call a resize() - returns the wrapper for chaining
resize(width, height) - resize the wrapper passing an optional width and height - returns wrapper for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most of the properties below resize the wrapper automatically
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone() - makes a copy of the Wrapper
dispose() - removes listeners and deletes object

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:
on(), off(), getBounds(), setBounds(), cache(), uncache(), updateCache(), dispatchEvent(),
addChild(), removeChild(), addChildAt(), getChildAt(), contains(), removeAllChildren(), etc.

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
items - an array of the wrapper items
items2D - read only array of rows each containing an array of colums of items
** see the parameter for descriptions of the following
** setting each will resize the wrapper at the current width and height

[57958] Tile(obj, cols, rows, spacingH, spacingV, unique, width, height, squeezeH, squeezeV, colSize, rowSize, align, valign, count, mirrorH, mirrorV, snapToPixel, clone, events, exact, style, group, inherit)

Tile
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Tile has two main uses:

1. ART
Creates a tile with an object for the columns and rows specified - a mirror effect is available too.
By default the object is cloned.
A ZIM VEE value can be passed to tile multiple types of objects

2. LAYOUT
Set the unique parameter to true to pass in an array of unique objects
** Pre ZIM Cat, a series() would be used with the count set if required and clone set to false to keep object events
Now this is handled by ZIM with the unique parameter, simplifying the process.
The array could be thumbnail pictures, interface bars, content sections on a page, etc.
Horizontal and vertical spacings can be set
Setting colSize and rowSize will override spacings and force grid dimensions
align and valign parameters can be used - or set with STYLE
setting a width or height will spread the items - and override the colSize and rowSize
In both dimensioned and non dimensioned modes,
the rows and columns can be squeezed together and aligned as a group
So a variety of layouts can be accommodated.

See: three videos on laying out with Tile
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1dwD_wd_-U - components - using unique parameter
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjWxhqSSdww - custom widths - series
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eSVkCOshE8 - leader board example

See: https://zimjs.com/tile.html for a dynamic example

NOTE: ZIM Layout() is available to layout content that is scaled into regions
Tile will NOT scale the content but of course, the Tile itself can be scaled.
And items can be manually scaled before or after adding - but Tile does not do any scaling.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle();
const tile = new Tile(circle, 20, 10).center();

EXAMPLE
// tile 10 rectangles spaced out across the stage
const tile = new Tile({obj:new Rectangle(), cols:10, spacingH:30, width:W*.9}).center();

EXAMPLE
// tile two rows with a Dial and a Slider in each
const tile = new Tile({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj:[new Dial(), new Slider(), new Dial(), new Slider()],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unique:true, // as of ZIM Cat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cols:2, rows:2,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spacingH:30, spacingV:30,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;valign:CENTER
}).center();
// use tile.getChildAt(0) to access first Dial - or:
tile.items[0].on("change", ()=&gt;{zog("changing dial 1")});
// See next example if events are already on items

EXAMPLE
// Like the previous example but with events specified before Tile is made
// Using the change() method which is chainable because it returns the object
// (Do not chain an on() method for the event as it does not return the object)
const d1 = new Dial().change(()=&gt;{zog("changing dial 1")});
const d2 = new Dial();
const s1 = new Slider();
const s2 = new Slider();
const tile = new Tile({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj:[d1, s1, d2, s2],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// with unique true, it uses objects in order
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// without picking randomly and without cloning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unique:true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cols:2, rows:2,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spacingH:30, spacingV:30,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;valign:CENTER
}).center();
// or after
s2.change(()=&gt;{zog("changing slider 2")});

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
obj - |ZIM VEE| (default new Circle()) the display object to tile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: put rotated objects in a container (unless rotated 180 degrees) and tile the container
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If obj is a String then the object will be turned into an asset(obj).centerReg({add:false}).clone() so a clone of the asset with id of obj.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the unique parameter is set then an array of objects can be used here (ZIM VEE will be turned off)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the obj is a ZIM VEE function (not array, object literal or series) then the Tile clone parameter will default to false
cols - (default 1 - if no cols and rows then 3) the columns to tile
rows - (default 1 - if no cols and rows then 3) the rows to tile
spacingH - (default 0 - if no cols and rows then 3) a spacing between columns - ignored if colSize is set
spacingV - (default 0 - if no cols and rows then 3) a spacing between rows - ignored if rowSize is set
unique - (default false) - set to true if tiling unique items like components with events set or objects with custom properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. this will turn off ZIM VEE for the obj parameter which will accept an array of unique objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. the count parameter will be set to the length of the array
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. and the clone parameter will be set to false&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
width - (default null) set to a width to spread items in rows evenly out to width (see resize() method)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;colSize and mirrorH are ignored if width is set
height - (default null) set to a height to spread items in columns evenly out to height (see resize() method)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rowSize and mirrorV are ignored if height is set
squeezeH - (default false) how to handle positioning within rows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when width is not set:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;false - will not compress tiles beyond max calculated width for column including spacingH
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;true - will treat all rows independently and fill spaces - align will align rows to widest row
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when width is set:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;false - will not compress past longest row including spacingH
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;true - will compress all rows - align will then align rows to widest row
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"full" - will continue to compress always keeping each row to the width (may cause overlap)
squeezeV - (default "none") how to handle positioning within columns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when height is not set:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;false - will not compress tiles beyond max calculated height for column including spacingV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;true - will treat all columns independently and fill spaces - valign will align columns to highest row
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when height is set:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;false - will not compress past longest column including spacingV
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;true - will compress all columns - valign will then align columns to longest column
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"full" - will continue to compress always keeping each column to the height
colSize - |ZIM VEE| (default item size) set to number to hard code column width (ignores spacing)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignored if width is set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use a series(100, 200, 100, 400) to set specific sizes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if using in STYLE then set delayPick:true as well
rowSize - |ZIM VEE| (default item size) set to number to hard code row height (ignores spacing)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignored if height is set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use a series(100, 200, 100, 400) to set specific sizes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if using in STYLE then set delayPick:true as well
align - |ZIM VEE (non-squeezed only)| (default LEFT) set to CENTER, MIDDLE, RIGHT
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is a basic align and may not work with rotated objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add these to a container perhaps for best results
valign - |ZIM VEE (non-squeezed only)| (default TOP) set to CENTER, MIDDLE, "bottom"
count - (default cols*rows - obj array length if unique is true) optional total number of items to tile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if count is set to 0 then count is ignored and a warning message is provided in console
mirrorH - (default false) flip alternating objects horizontally (works with top left registration point)
mirrorV - (default false) flip alternating objects vertically (works with top left registration point)
snapToPixel - (default true) sets the stage to snapToPixelEnabled and snaps to pixels to avoid small gaps when Tile is repositioned
clone - (default true - or false if unique is true or false if obj is ZIM VEE function) set to false to prevent Tile from cloning objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see unique parameter
events - (default false) Boolean - set to true to receive change events from elements of Tile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this allows using one change event (or change() method) for a set of components in the Tile
exact - (default false) Boolean - set to true to exactly clone the obj rather than let ZIM VEE Pick values activate
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
itemUnderPoint(x, y, ignoreSpacing) - gets the item under a global point - (within item's col and row dimensions)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** will not work properly with squeeze and gets original items - so not items that are moved
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x and y are F.mouseX, F.mouseY for example.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignoreSpacing defaults to true and is a bigger selection space if there is spacing (can also be set to HORIZONTAL or VERTICAL to ignore only one direction)
remake(items) - pass in an array of items to tile - see items property for editing current list - returns tile for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can also change rows and cols and remake()
resize(width, height) - resize the tile with new width and/or height if the width and/or height parameters were set - returns tile for chaining
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone(exact) - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exact (default false) ZIM VEE (Pick) values are active in clones unless exact is set to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, if a Tile is made with new Circle(20,[blue,green])
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then its clone will have random blue or green circles that will differ from the original
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If exact is set to true then the clone will the same colors as the original
dispose() - removes listeners and deletes object

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.

[58724] Pack(width, height, items, spacingH, spacingV, flatten, direction, lock, backgroundColor, align, valign, lastAlign, paddingH, paddingV, dragOrder, dragColor, dragThickness, dragDashed, reverse, funnel, showPacking, order, style, group, inherit)

Pack
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Pack scales objects so they are packed within a width and height.
This means that some objects will scale more than others.
Pack works with the rectangular bounds of the objects.
The Pack will most likely not fit exactly in the dimensions provided
but it can be aligned or valigned within the dimensions and padding and backgroundColor set.
The dragOrder parameter can be set to true to allow objects to be sorted.
And the pack can be added to a TransformManager to remember the order on refresh.
There are lots of subtle options with the main ones described below:

FLATTEN
If flatten is true (default) then Pack will integrate any trailing items so the Pack is completely rectangular.
It may integrate at the start (default) or at the end - and it does so in two rows (or columns) to minify the effect.
The effect will be that these two rows or columns will have somewhat bigger items.
If flatten is false then the left over items can be aligned with lastAlign.
Note that align and valign is for the placements of the whole pack in the dimensions provided.

DIRECTION
Direction HORIZONTAL (default) will order the items horizontally to fill a row then go to the next row (like a Tile).
This will leave horizontal seams but will not necessarily fill the horizontal space - see LOCK below.
Direction VERTICAL will order the items vertically along rows and when the column is done then go to the next column.
This will leave vertical seams but will not necessarily fill the vertical space - see LOCK below.
There is also a reverse parameter that will order these in the opposite direction (right to left or bottom to top).

LOCK
Lock HORIZONTAL will make the pack fit to the side edges - probably leaving a gap in the vertical.
Lock VERTICAL will make the pack fit to the vertical top and bottom - probably leaving a gap in the horizontal.
Lock can be set to AUTO to pick the best fit between these based on the largest area of the pack.

ORDER
There is a dragOrder parameter (default false) that can be set to true to let users drag items to change the order.
This will repack each time.  There are also getOrder() and setOrder() methods to record the order
and pass it back in to the order parameter of Pack.
This allows the app/content creators to try out different views and choose one.
The pack can also be passed into a ZIM TransformManager() along with a persist ID to let users save their order.

See: https://zimjs.com/zim/pack.html - pictures and saving
See: https://zimjs.com/zim/pack2.html - in a resizeable window

NOTE: ZIM Tile() has squeeze which can squeeze the items in horizontally or vertically.
ZIM Wrapper() will wrap items to fit best in rows or columns
but both of these will not scale its items and the results will be ragged edges.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
new Pack(rand(200,600), rand(200,600)).center(); // packs three default rectangles

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
width - (default 500) the outer width of the pack object which will define the backgroundColor and enclose the content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use the outerWidth property to change once the pack is made as the width property will just scale the pack.
height - (default 500) the outer height of the pack object which will define the backgroundColor and enclose the content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use the outerHeight property to change once the pack is made as the width property will just scale the pack.
items - (default three colored Rectangles) set to an array of items to pack - can be pictures or any DisplayObject - even interactive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the items property will reference this array as originally ordered (plus any items added or removed with addAt() or removeAt())
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is also a currentItems property that has the same items but in the latest order based on dragOrder or the order property
spacingH - (default 10) set the horizontal spacing between the items - this is almost exact but may be a little less if direction horizontal and lock is vertical
spacingV - (default 10) set the vertical spacing between the items - this is amost exact but may be a little less if direction vertical and lock horizontal
flatten - (default true) merge any left-over items into the previous two rows to make the end flat
direction - (default HORIZONTAL) order the items horizontally or vertically - this will create seams in the chosen direction
lock - (default AUTO) set to VERTICAL to fit content from top to bottom (less padding) or HORIZONTAL to fit content to sides (less padding)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to AUTO to pick the direction that gives the largest content area.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: that this setting is independent of the direction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the pack may not fit perfectly in the dimensions provided (probably not) so this setting specifies which side to lock to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the align and valign parameters then can be used to align the content in the provided width and height
backgroundColor - (default clear) set this to show a background rectangle behind the content dimensioned to the width and height
align - (default CENTER) horizontal alignment of the content in the provided dimensions - if lock is vertical (also LEFT and RIGHT)
valign - (default CENTER) vertical alignment of the content in the provided dimensions - if lock is horizontal (also TOP and BOTTOM)
lastAlign - (default LEFT/TOP) if flatten is false the the alignment of the left over items
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT for direction HORIZONTAL or TOP, CENTER, BOTTOM for direction VERTICAL
paddingH - (default 0) the horizontal space between the outer dimension and the content
paddingV - (default 0) the vertical space between the outer dimension and the content
dragOrder - (default false) set to true to let users (or authors) drag the items to new positions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will re-pack the pack and possibly shift items to new columns or rows or even shift lock orientation if lock is AUTO
dragColor - (default white) the color of the ghost rectangle and beacon diamond - also see ghost and beacon properties
dragThickness - (default 2) the thickness of the ghost and beacon
dragDashed - (default true) the dashed of the ghost
reverse - (default false) set to true to reverse the pack order
funnel - (default false) set to true to add fewer items to the edges causing a larger to smaller look when flatten is true
showPacking - (default false) set to true to show packing steps at an interval of 1 second - for interest only
order - (default null) set to an array of order data - see getOrder() get the array after dragging and setOrder() to dynamically set an order
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the format is [index, index, index, etc.] for each item where index is the new desired index for each original item
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see TransformManager(pack, "id") to automatically save the current order and remake the pack in the last order on refresh
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
getOrder(popup) - get the current order of the pack if dragOrder is set to true - pass in true to see order in a ZIM Pane
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can then be copied and pasted into the Pack() order parameter to start the pack at the desired order
setOrder(order) - pass in an array of desired order - see the Pack() order parameter for more info - returns the object for chaining
addAt(items, index) - pass a single or an array of items to add to the pack at the provided index (or at the end if no index) - returns the object for chaining
removeAt(number, index) - remove the specified number of items at the provided index (or at the end if no index) - returns the object for chaining
clone() - make a copy of the pack
dispose() - removes listeners and deletes object

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.

************************************
[59575] Beads(path, obj, count, angle, startPercent, endPercent, percents, onTop, showControls, visible, interactive, clone, group, style, inherit)

Beads
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION

Beads adds objects around a Squiggle or Blob path.
Different objects can be specified with ZIM VEE (Pick) values
to put random or sequenced objects around path.
The objects should have center registration for the most part.
Although animating, wiggling or customizing the registration can be cool.
The count of the object and the start and end percents can be specified

Beads can be used to make dotted borders or bead-like art.
The path can be any Squiggle or Blob - see https://zimjs.com/paths/ for example
The beads property holds the beads and can be animated in sequence

See https://zimjs.com/ten/beads.html for a mini-site of examples

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
new Beads({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;path:new Blob({points:"rectangle"}),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj:new Circle(5, series(red, blue)),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visible:false,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;count:52
}).center();

EXAMPLE
const sun = new Beads({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;path:new Blob({color:yellow}), //.radialGradient([yellow,orange],[.2,.8],0,0,0, 0,0,100),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj:new Triangle(60, 60, 60, series(orange,yellow,red)).reg(null, 60),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interactive:false,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;count:9
}).center().drag({all:true});

// here we animate the beads property of Beads - which holds only the beads (not the path)
// sequence is automatically set to 0 to animate each bead individually
// to animate all the beads, animate on the main beads object
// You can still set a sequence to a value to run a sequence
sun.beads.animate({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props:{scaleY:1.7},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time:{min:1.5, max:2},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rewind:true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loop:true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// sequence:200
});

path, obj, count, angle, startPercent, endPercent, percents, onTop, showControls, visible, interactive, clone, group, style, inherit

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
path - (default new Blob({borderColor:blue})) a ZIM Squiggle or Blob on which to place the objects
obj - |ZIM VEE| the display object to place along the path - or use [] or series() for alternatives - also, see clone()
count - (default 10) the number of objects to place
angle - (default null) set to a specific angle such as 0 to keep all objects upright
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the default of null will align the objects normal (out from) the curve (at 90 degrees from the tangent at its placement point)

endPercent - (default 100 or 100-spacing for Blob) an end percent for the last object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be smaller than startPercent to wrap around past 100
percents - (default null) an array of percent spacings to override default evenly spaced percents (also see percents property)
onTop - (default false) set to true to let the blob or squiggle come to the top of the bead object when manipulated
showControls - (default false) set to true to start off with the controls showing (also see interactive)
visible - (default true) set to false to not see the Blob or Squiggle path
interactive - (default true) set to false to not interact with the Blob or Squiggle path
clone - (default true) set to false to prevent Beads from cloning objects - good for series if events or custom properties are placed on each object
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
resize() - call resize if programatically changing the Squiggle or Blob path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will be done automatically when using path controls
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone(exact) - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exact (default false) ZIM VEE (Pick) values are active in clones unless exact is set to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, if Beads is made with new Circle(20,[blue,green])
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then its clone will have random blue or green circles that will differ from the original
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If exact is set to true then the clone will the same colors as the original
dispose() - removes listeners and deletes object

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.

************************************
[59809] Layout(holder, regions, lastMargin, lastMarginMin, backgroundColor, vertical, showRegions, scalingObject, hideKey, style, group, inherit)

Layout
zim class - extends a createjs.EventDispatcher

DESCRIPTION
Layout arranges objects on the page by fitting (scaling) them in regions.
Make a layout object for each page if desired
and even nest layout objects inside regions.
Fixed aspect ratio content is fit into regions.
Layout is good for flexive design where you anchor titles and navigation.
Layout handles any number of regions vertically or horizontally.
It is useful for full scale mode for different devices or browser window scale.

NOTE: As of ZIM ZIM 02, a GlobalManager will be used to resize any Layout objects.

SPECIAL:
** If the object in a region is a Wrapper, the wrapper will be scaled
to fit the region width of a vertical Layout and the height of a horizontal Layout
See: https://zimjs.com/ten/wrapper.html
** If the object in a region is a Window, the window will be scaled to the region.
** If the object is given a type="Region" then it will have its bounds set to the region size.
This allows for another Layout to be nested within a region and scale to the inner region.
For example:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var content = new Container(500,500);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;content.type = "Region"; // this now will have its bounds set to the region size
If the object is a Container (usual choice) then it must be given a starting width and height
which will be reset to the region size and resized to continue to match the region size.
SEE: https://zimjs.com/explore/layouts.html
SEE: https://zimjs.com/cat/layout.html

SEE: https://zimjs.com/pages
SEE: https://codepen.io/zimjs/pen/oMRprj

NOTE: ZIM Tile is available to lay out non-scaled content

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// these would be containers with your content
// make sure that bounds are set on containers
// you may want to hard code bounds for clarity
const header = new Rectangle(500, 200, blue);
const content = new Rectangle(600, 500, green);
const footer = new Rectangle(500, 200, blue);
S.addChild(header, content, footer);

// make a vertical Layout - more useful for FULL scale mode
const layout = new Layout({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;holder:stage,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regions:[
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{obj:header, marginTop:10, maxWidth:80, minHeight:10, valign:TOP},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{obj:content, marginTop:5, maxWidth:90}, // note, middle gets no minHeight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{obj:footer, marginTop:5, maxWidth:80, height:10}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lastMargin:5
});

// As of ZIM ZIM 02, A GlobalManager will automatically be added
// to resize any Layout objects

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
holder - object to hold layout (stage, container, etc) that must have bounds set
regions - an array of region DisplayObjects with specific properties for each region
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(or array of DisplayObjects for defaults)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example VERTICAL region objects - all dimensions are percents
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[{obj:title, marginTop:10, maxWidth:80, minHeight:20, align:LEFT, valign:TOP},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{obj:content, marginTop:5, maxWidth:90}, // note, middle gets no minHeight
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{obj:nav, marginTop:5, maxWidth:80, height:20, backgroundColor:red}]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: no minHeight for middle regions - but heights on any region
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;align defaults to middle for the regions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;valign defaults to top and bottom for the top and bottom region and middle for the others
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;backgroundColor applies a backing color to the region
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example HORIZONTAL region objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[{obj:col1, marginLeft:10, maxHeight:80, width:20, valign:"bottom"},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{obj:col2, marginLeft:5, maxHeight:90, align:MIDDLE}, // note, middle gets no minWidth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{obj:col3, marginLeft:5, maxHeight:80, minWidth:20, align:LEFT, valign:TOP}]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;align defaults to left and right for the outer regions and middle for the inside regions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;valign defaults to top for all the regions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** See the SPECIAL section above in the description for Wrapper, Window and Region objects
lastMargin - (default 0) the margin at the bottom (vertical) or at the right (horizontal)
lastMarginMin - (default 0) the minimum margin at the bottom (vertical) or at the right (horizontal)
backgroundColor - (default null) background color for the whole holder
vertical - (default true) set to false for horizontal layout
showRegions - (default null) show boundaries of regions (formerly regionShape)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can toggle on and off with B key if this is set to true
scalingObject - (default holder) an object used as the bounds of the region scaling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting a scalingObject will also set the bounds of the holder to the scalingObject bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it does not scale the holder - only scales the region objects inside
hideKey - (default B) is the hot key for hiding and showing the bounds

METHODS
resize() - resize based on new bounds of the holder (or scalingObject)
toggle(state - default null) - toggle() will show controls if they are hidden or hide controls if they are showing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alternatively, pass in true to show controls or false to hide controls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note - method does not update the stage
addShape(shape) - adds a bounding shape dynamically
removeShape() - permanently removes the bounding shape
disable() - disables all the layout (shape and sizing)
enable() - enables all the layout (shape and sizing)
dispose() - removes backgroundColors and bounds key event
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to get rid of the objects in the layout call dispose on those objects in the app

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
regions - the regions object - if changed will have to call resize() manually
backing - the Shape that holds all the background colors
toggled - read-only Boolean as to whether the controls are showing or hidden

DESCRIPTION OF FLEXIVE DESIGN
here described with vertical layout - horizontal is similar but rotated 90
the content in the middle will try and expand against the top and bottom
until it forces the top and bottom to their minimum percents
if the content hits its maximum width percent first then the top and bottom
will fill up the rest of the height until they reach their maximum widths

Accessibility
zim class - extends a createjs.EventDispatcher

DESCRIPTION
Adds Screen Reader accessibility to the canvas for TAB key or Swipe (mobile) highlighting of ZIM objects
Some objects can be activated using the ENTER key and adjusted using the ARROW keys
Default or custom titles can be set to be read by the Screen Reader
The objects and the order in which the objects recieve focus can be set with a tabOrder array
A text message can be passed to the talk() method and it will be read by a Screen Reader

NOTE: Instructions to activate a screen reader on desktop or laptop computers
On Windows, you can type Narrator into Cortana and run it - it is really easy
On Mac, under Accessibility choose Voice Over
On Android, under Accesibility choose Voice and turn on TalkBack
Windows worked at ZIM 6, Apple worked at 6.1.0, Android worked at 6.1.0 aside from Slider, Dial, Stepper and ColorPicker
Custom readers were not tested

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const button = new Button().center()
button.on("mousedown", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zgo("http://zimjs.com");
});
const dial = new Dial().center().mov(200);

const accessibility = new Accessibility();
// this will automatically read in all objects on the stage and give default messages for the Screen Reader
// ENTER key events will be added to objects that will translate to mousedown and click events on the object
// Tab (swipe on mobile) to focus on the Button and press enter (double tap on mobile) to go to the ZIM site
// The Dial can use arrows to increase and decrease its value (up and right increase, down and left decrease)
// On mobile, double tapping the Dial brings up a select box with options (as does Slider, Stepper, and ColorPicker)

// OR

const accessibility = new Accessibility("Second Example");
accessibility.tabOrder = [
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dial,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{obj:button, title:"Press ENTER to go to ZIM site"}
];
// this will start and end the app with "Second Example" being read (rather than default, "application")
// the dial will be the first item to tab to
// the button has a tabOrder object so it will have the title read rather than the default button message
// You could also provide a tabOrder object for the dial as well

NOTE: Please see https://zimjs.com/screenreader for a detailed example
NOTE: Please see https://zimjs.com/accessibility for a more examples

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
appName - (default "application") read in screen reader when application receives or loses focus
tabOrder - (default an array of all ZIM Display Objects on stage) an array of zim Display Objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These will be given TAB key control (and ENTER and ARROWS) and will work with Screen Readers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or given swipe left/right and double tap on mobile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Alternatively, an array of tabOrder objects with an obj property and a title property can be used
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The obj is the Dispay Object and the title is what is read by the Screen Reader
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. {obj:button, title:"Press Enter Key to start game"}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can also specify tabOrder as a property of Accessibility
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The tabOrder may change compared to the array that is initially provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** as RadioButtons, Picker, Tabs, and Pad components are split into separate items
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** For objects not on the stage including a Pane, Waiter, etc. do not rely on the auto adding, use the parameter specified array instead.
tabIndex - (default -1) - a starting index for focus - or can set tabIndex property after object is made
cycle - (default false) set to true to keep tab order inside application rather than leaving application when an end is reached
decimals - (default 2) number of decimals max to read for screen reader
frame - (default currentFrame) the frame
application - (default true - false on mobile) set to false to set role of buttons as buttons rather than application - may cause problems with NVDA unless set to forms mode
alwaysHighlight - (default false) screen readers will add their own highlights - but this will set highlight to true even if there is no screen reader
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set to true to place a rectangle around the object being put into focus by pressing the tab key or swipe on mobile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will replace screen reader highlights (eg. for Windows Narrator) except for when aria is true (eg. Apple Voice Over)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the parameters relate to the alwaysHighlight - meaning highlight even if there is no screen reader
AHTime - (default .7) seconds to show the alwaysHighlight (also see ZIM TIME constant)
AHColor - (default brown) - the color of the alwaysHighlight rectangle
AHBorderWidth - (default 3) thickness of border
AHBorderPadding - (default 5) distance from object bounds outward towards border
AHAlpha - (default .8) alpha of the alwaysHighlight
AHObject - (default null) set to a display object - including animated objects - to override the rectangle as a alwaysHighlight object
AHObjectScale - (default .8) scale the AHObject relative to the object with tab focus

METHODS
tab(dir) - set dir to 1 (default) to emulate tab forward or -1 to emulate shift tab
changeTitle(target, title, activate) - change a title for the Screen Reader
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;target - the tabObject (eg. button) or the tabIndex of the item in the tabOrder to change
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** The tabOrder may change compared to the array that is initially provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** as RadioButtons, Picker, Tabs, and Pad components are split into separate items
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title - the new title that will be read to the screen reader
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no title is provided any component passed will just update to its currentValue or selectedIndex
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;activate (default false) - set to true to set focus of item at index and send to Screen Reader
talk(words) - tell the Screen Reader to read the words provided (does not affect focus)
resize(target) - target is the object or index of the object to update - or do not pass a target to update all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This needs to be done if the object is moved, scaled, or removed from / re-added to the stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accessibility works by placing HTML tags behind the canvas where the ZIM objects exist - so resize() handles this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the Frame resize event and optionally, the ResizeManager()
dispose() - removes listeners and sets tabOrder to []

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
tabOrder - get or set an array with the order in which display objects will receive focus with tab and shift tab (swipe on mobile)
tabIndex - get or set the index of the tabOrder (also see currentObject)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting works only if object at the index is on the stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returns -1 if no tabOrder object has the focus
currentObject - get or set the object in the tabOrder that has focus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Objects have the following Accessibility properties added:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zimAccessibility - the accessibility object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zimTabIndex - the index in the tabOrder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zimTabTag - the HTML tag that is used to represent the object to the screen reader
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zimTabParent - the parent of an object for RadioButtons, Tabs, and Pads (for others, the zimTabParent is the object)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tabIndex - the index of the tag in tabParent (if there is a parent)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type - the type of object. If there is a zimTabParent (that is not itself), the type is RadioButton, TabsButton or PadButton
activatedObject - get the object in the tabOrder that was last clicked or had the ENTER key pressed on
startAppTag - get the HTML tag that announces application start
endAppTag - get the HTML tag that announces application end
cycle - (default false) set to true to keep tab order inside application rather than leaving application when an end is reached
decimals - (default 2) number of decimals max to read for screen reader
frame - (default currentFrame) the frame
alwaysHighlight - Boolean to use a alwaysHighlight rectangle
AHTime - seconds to show the hightlight (also see ZIM TIME constant)
AHColor - the color of the alwaysHighlight rectangle
AHBorderWidth - thickness of border
AHBorderPadding - (default 5)distance from object bounds outward towards border
AHAlpha - alpha of the alwaysHighlight
AHObject - set to a display object - including animated objects - to override the rectangle as a alwaysHighlight object
AHObjectScale - scale the AHObject relative to the object with tab focus
enabled - default is true - set to false to disable

EVENTS
Dispatches a "change" event when the screen reader is about to talk
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is when the talk() method runs or the tabIndex is changed (from click, swipe, tab, changeTitle - with activate true)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The event object has a title property that holds the words the screen reader will say
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several change events can happen at the same time so what is said is usually the last
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the talk() method takes priority as it runs in alert mode so focus is not lost
The Enter key dispatches mousedown and click events from object with focus
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The event object has a fromEnter property which is true if from an enter key on the object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This could trigger a button press for instance

TextureActive
zim class extends a zim Page which extends a ZIM Container which extends a createjs Container

DESCRIPTION
A TextureActive object is a Container that can be used as a CanvasMaterial in three.js.
This allows ZIM to be mapped onto any material and mesh in three.js.
For instance, ZIM can be used as interface panels in virtual reality.
Any material can be made interactive so games and puzzles could be on walls, or any models.
This has world-wide wonderful applications!

NOTE: used with three.js

WORKINGS
The TextureActive object can be passed into a ZIM TextureActives() object to be made interactive.
The TextureActives object uses raycasting on the three.js material to provide CreateJS x and y coordinates.
The three.js mesh must be passed to the TextureActives addMesh() method.
The ZIM CreateJS 1.4.0 and later must be used as there are two settings:
createjs.remotePointers and createjs.remoteQueue
These prepare CreateJS to receive x and y from three.js and update TextureActive cache and material needsUpdate flag.

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
width - (default zimDefaultFrame.width) the width of the TextureActive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but backing is sized to screen.width if no width is provided
height - (default zimDefaultFrame.height) the height of the Page
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but backing is sized to screen.height if no height is provided
color - (default zim.light) the color of the TextureActive
color2 - (default null) a second color which would form a zim.GradientColor() as the color
angle - (default 90) the angle for the gradient if there is a gradient
borderColor - (default null) the stroke color

can also be a combination array of values and skew arrays
[topLeft, [horizontal, vertical], bottomRight, [horizontal, vertical]]
interactive - (default true) set to false to not be interactive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interactive will use raycasting in the TextureActives object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to provide x and y to CreateJS which is then used by ZIM
animated - (default true) set to false if no animation is necessary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note that the animation will be true if interactive is true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this tells ZIM to update the cache of the TextureActive every stage update
backingOrbit - (default true) set to false to not allow oribitControls to rotate when pressed on backing
pattern - (default null) a DisplayObject that will be added to the TextureActive above the backing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, import zim_pizzazz and use:

scalePattern - (default "fill") scale the pattern so it fills the window (formerly "bigger" or "outside")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to false for no scaling or:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIT or "fit" fits inside the TextureActive keeping proportion (formerly "smallest")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FILL or "fill" fills the TextureActive keeping proportion (formerly "biggest" or "outside")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FULL or "full" keeps both x and y scales - may stretch object (formerly "both")
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
clone() - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied - note, contents are not cloned
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

TextureActives
zim class extends a createjs EventDispatcher

DESCRIPTION
The ZIM TextureActive system allows ZIM to be used within three.js
as a CanvasTexture for any material in any mesh.
This can be animated and interacted with.
For instance, ZIM can be used as interface panels in virtual reality.
Any material can be made interactive so games and puzzles could be on walls, or any models.
This has world-wide wonderful applications!

TextureActives applies the interactivity to TextureActive objects
and has an addMesh() method to register three.js meshes with their TextureActive
A TextureActives object must be made after the TextureActive objects are made
and after a three.js renderer, scene, camera and constrols are made.
But it can be made before the meshes that use the TextureActive objects are made.
Then either a Three.makePanel() or a textureActives.addMesh() method can be used to add TextureActive objects.

NOTE: used with three.js

WORKINGS
The TextureActive object can be passed into a ZIM TextureActives() object to be made interactive.
The TextureActives object uses raycasting on the three.js material to provide CreateJS x and y coordinates.
The three.js mesh must be passed to the TextureActives addMesh() method.
The ZIM CreateJS 1.4.0 and later must be used as there are two settings:
createjs.remotePointers and createjs.remoteQueue
These prepare CreateJS to receive x and y from three.js and update TextureActive cache and material needsUpdate flag.

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
actives - a ZIM TextureActive object or an array of ZIM TextureActive objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see the add() method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these will be tiled in ZIM and used to be mapped as a CanvasTexture onto three.js materials for meshes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see https://zimjs.com/docs.html?item=TextureActive
threejs - reference to the three.js namespace
zimThree - (default null) reference to the ZIM Three object if the Three helper module is used (saves lots of lines!)
renderer - reference to the three.js renderer (if using Three, then three.renderer)
scene - reference to the three.js scene (if using Three, then three.scene)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if using more than one scene then make more than one TexureActives object
camera - reference to the three.js camera (if using Three, then three.camera)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if using more than one camera then make more than one TexureActives object
controls - (default null) a three.js OrbitControls or FirstPersonControls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other controls may work but are not directly accomodated
layers - (default 0) a layer number from 0 to 31 or an array of layers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will instruct the raycaster to look at only the provided layers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is a good idea to specify 1 for instance and add TexureActive meshes to layer 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the addMesh() method has a layer parameter that should match the layer number used here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Three makePanel() method will automatically add the panel mesh to the layer specified for the TextureActives object
near - (default undefined) - the start of the distance-from-camera range for the object to be interactive
far - (default undefined) - the end of the distance-from-camera range for the object to be interactive
ignoreList - (default null) - a mesh or array of meshes to ignore if between the camera and the TextureActive mesh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by default, meshes on the same layer will prevent interactivity if between the camera and the TextureActive mesh
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the mesh is not on the same layer then it will be ignored by default
toggleKey - (default t) the key to toggle to or from the ZIM canvas and the three.js canvas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can be used to directly interact with the ZIM objects - good for testing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ZIM objects are tiled horizontally with a slider or swiping to pan across them
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the toggle can be deactivated by setting it to -1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or any time by setting the textureActives.manager.toggleKey to -1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ZIM canvas and toggling is handled by the ZIM TextureActivesManager
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is automatically made as soon as one TextureActives object is made
color - (default darker) the color for the ZIM stage (when the toggle key is pressed)
outerColor - (default black) the color of off the ZIM stage (when the toggle key is pressed)
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
add(actives) - add a ZIM TextureActive object or an array of ZIM TextureActive objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or see the actives parameter of TextureActives
remove(actives) - remove a ZIM TextureActive object or an array of ZIM TextureActive objects
addMesh(mesh, layer) - add a three.js mesh to TextureActives at the option layer - see the layer parameter of TextureActives
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see the ZIM Three helper module makePanel() method to easily make a three.js Plane mesh with a TextureActive
dispose() - removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
interactive - get whether there are interactive TextureActive objects
animated - get whether there are animated TextureActive objects
manager - the ZIM TexureActivesManager object that handles toggling between the three.js canvas and the ZIM canvas
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is used to interact directly with ZIM for testing, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and can be used to toggle between states and change or remove the key for toggling
ignoreList - get or set the array of three.js meshes to ignore - see the ignoreList parameter of TextureActives
raycaster - a reference to the three.Raycaster object if the TextureActives is interactive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is responsible for geting x and y coordinates on TextureActive materials and sending them to CreateJS
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where they replace the regular DOM mouse or pointer events
raycast - get or set whether the raycaster is operational
renderer - the three.js renderer
layers - get an array of layers used by the raycaster
actives - get an array of ZIM TextureActive objects currently being used - see add() and remove()
threeMeshes - get an array of three.js meshes currently being used - see addMesh() and add() and remove()

EVENTS
raydown - dispatched when mouse is down on a ZIM TextureActive material
raymove - dispatched when mouse is moving on a ZIM TextureActive material
rayup - dispatched when mouse is up on a ZIM TextureActive material
rayover - dispatched when mouse is moves over a ZIM TextureActive material
rayout - dispatched when mouse is moves out from a ZIM TextureActive material

[62622] Manager()

DEPRECATED - as of ZIM ZIM 02, a GlobalManager is added to handle any resizing

Manager
zim class

DESCRIPTION
used internally to make ResizeManager, GridManager and GuideManager
and in future perhaps OutlineManager

METHODS
** all methods return the manager for chaining except dispose which returns true
add(obj) - registers a object or array of objects with the manager
** the following methods will operate on all objects in manager if the object parameter is left empty
** if a specific object or an array of objects is provided then the methods will operate on those objects
remove(obj) - removes objects from the manager
resize(obj) - resizes objects in the manager
toggle(state, obj) - toggles objects - leave state off for toggle or pass in true to see or false to hide
dispose(obj) - disposes objects in the manager


************************************
[62725] ResizeManager()

DEPRECATED - as of ZIM ZIM 02, a GlobalManager is added to handle any resizing

ResizeManager
zim class extends zim.Manager abstract class

DESCRIPTION
Add objects with a resize() method to a ResizeManager object and call a single resize() on the ResizeManager object
This will most likely go in a resize event on the Frame
Works with objects such as Layout, Pages, Grid, Guide, Accessibility, Loader and TextArea

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const resizeManager = new ResizeManager();
resizeManager.add([pages, layout, accessibility]);
// where these three objects have already been made
// *** Note that the Loader and TextArea are already resized if added to an Accessibility object that is resized
F.on("resize", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resizeManager.resize(); // without ResizeManager you would make three different resize() calls
})

METHODS
add(obj) - adds object or an array of objects to the ResizeManager - returns the manager for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*** Note that the Loader and TextArea are already resized if added to an Accessibility object that is resized
remove(obj) - removes object or an array of objects from the ResizeManager - returns the manager for chaining
resize() - calls the resize() method of any object in the ResizeManager - returns the manager for chaining
dispose() - disposes the objects in the ResizeManager and the ResizeManager itself

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
items - get or set an array of objects currently in the Manager



************************************
[62770] TransformManager(objects, persistID)

TransformManager
zim class extends CreateJS EventDispatcher

DESCRIPTION
Manages multiple objects with transform() methods set.
Can use to show, hide, hideAll, add, remove and resize transform controls.
Also works with Squiggle(), Blob(), Layer(), Connectors() and Pack().
Can be used to automatically save any transforms and reload them again on refresh of Browser / App.
This uses localStorage.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const rect = new Rectangle(300, 200, green)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.centerReg()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.mov(-200)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.transform();

const circ = new Circle(100, red)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.centerReg()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.mov(200)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.transform();

const tm = new TransformManager([rect, circ], "sample");
// or use methods:
// tm.add([rect, circ]);
// tm.persist("sample"); // or add later to save transforms

PARAMETERS
objects - (default null) adds the object(s) to the Transform Manager
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass in a single object or an array of multiple objects
persistID - (default null) String id to make ZIM remember transforms of objects (uses localStorage)

METHODS
add(obj) - adds object or an array of objects to the TransformManager
remove(obj) - removes object or an array of objects to the TransformManager
show(obj) - show controls for an object that has a transform() set
hide(obj) - hides controls for an object that has a transform() set - still available with click
hideAll() - hides all controls - still available with click
resize() - calls the resize() method of any object in the ResizeManager
persist(id) - save data after every change and reload transforms when done - must provide an id
clearPersist(id) - clear persisting data - do this before adding shapes - must provide an id
savePersist() - with persist() already set, this will force a saving even without a transform event being captured
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if resize() after non-transform movement is called, then this is not needed
stopPersist() - no longer save data
dispose(removePersist, removeControls) - default just removes manager - keeps the data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set removePersist to true to remove the persist data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set removeControls to true to remove the transforms and beziers of all the items

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
items - get or set (set not recommended) an array of objects currently in the TransformManager
currentObject - the last item to get transform tools if it still has the transform tools active
persistData - gets the persist data if it exists

EVENTS
Dispatches a "transformed" event when pressup on any of the controls or on click
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transformed event object has transformObject and transformType properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the transformType property has values of:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOR TRANSFORM: "select" (if not moved), "size", "move", "rotate", "stretch", "reg" "reset"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOR BLOB, SQUIGGLE: "move", "bezierPoint", "bezierHandle", "bezierSwitch"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOR CONNECTORS: "connection"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOR PACK: "change"
Adds "transformshow" and "transformhide" events for when click to hide or show controls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these have a transformObject property to indicate what was shown or hidden
Dispatches, on each object, a "persistset" event when persist data is ready - could be delayed 50ms due to Layer being created
Dispatches a "persistcomplete" event when all persist data has been set + 100ms for layers to be set before applying controls



************************************
[63224] GuideManager()

DEPRECATED - as of ZIM ZIM 02, a GlobalManager is added to handle any resizing

GuideManager
zim class - extends the ZIM Manager abstract class

DESCRIPTION
Add Zim Guide objects to a GuideManager object and update or remove all guides at once.
Guides are handy to use but perhaps annoying to update and remove if you have many.
GuideManager keeps track of the guides and lets you update or dispose of them on command.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const manager = new GuideManager();
manager.add(new Guide());
manager.add(new Guide(false));

// or with pixels
// manager.add(new Guide(true, false));
// manager.add(new Guide(false, false));

// manager.dispose();
// handy with guides on multiple Pages

// and in frame resize event we can resize all guides:
F.on("resize", ()=&gt;{manager.resize();})

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
items - an array of all Guide objects added with add()

METHODS
add(guide) - registers a guide with the GuideManager
remove(guide) - removes guide from register
resize() - resizes all the guides in the GuideManager (ie. if stage changes)
toggle(state - default null) - toggle() will show controls if they are hidden or hide controls if they are showing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alternatively, pass in true to show controls or false to hide controls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note - method does not update the stage
dispose() - disposes all guides and the GuideManager

NOTE: to just hide guides, you use the G key
and to toggle percent and pixels use the P key
you can dispose guides individually or use this class to dispose all
disposing will remove the G, P key listener and the guide

************************************
[63715] Bind(connection, bindType, master, masterFilter, couple, smartDecimals, report, setDefault)

Bind
zim class

DESCRIPTION
Binds DisplayObject properties to data, for instance localStorage or server data
The property values can be any JSON valid data such as Number, String, Array or Object Literal

NOTE: see bind() methods of DisplayObjects like Containers, ZIM Shapes, Shapes, Bitmap, etc.

NOTE: see ZIM Base() in PHP for database access https://zimjs.com/php/base.zip

NOTE: see ZIM Skool Data lesson 09 https://zimjs.com/skool/lesson09.html
And asociated videos here https://zimjs.com/learnjavascript.html#lesson09

Bind has to() and from() methods that can be used to update data and properties as desired.
to() saves data and from() gets data and sets object properties.
These have filters to specify on which ids, objects or properties to act.
LOCALSTORAGE, POST and GET is supported as are these global ZIM constants.

The data has JSON.strigify() applied and will be sent as a data property
Bind has a master parameter that will be sent with all to() and from() calls
to() and from() calls will send a command property of either "to" or "from"
There is also an extra property that can be used to send an id, search term, etc.
These can be collected, for instance in PHP, as follows depending on the bindType
$_GET["data"], $_GET["master"], $_GET["command"], $_GET["extra"], $_GET["unique"] or
$_POST["data"], $_POST["master"], $_POST["command"], $_POST["extra"], $_POST["unique"]
Separating the data from the master, command and extra more readily allows JSON storage

GET uses ZIM asnyc() which is JSONp based and overcomes Cross Origin security issues
GET has a limit of 2048 - some servers are more but some are not
POST uses ZIM Ajax() which will work with the same server or one with CORS set accordingly
POST has a limit of roughly the computer memory
LOCALSTORAGE is also supported which stores the data on the user's computer

See: https://zimjs.com/ten/bind.html

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// LOCALSTORAGE example - synchronous so do not need callback
const b = new Bind();
// b.clear(); // clear localStorage memory

// circle's location will be remembered
const c = new Circle().center().bind("circle", ["x","y"]).drag();
c.on("pressup", ()=&gt;{b.to();});

// TextArea's text will be remembered
const t = new TextArea().center().mov(0,-100).bind("text", ["text"]);
t.on("input", ()=&gt;{b.to();});

EXAMPLE
// A GET example - POST is the same - see comments in PHP template...

// get unique user id from components, etc.
// this could be added to the url for get
// but we will pass it in as master data which works for get or post
// to tell the to() and from() methods to always pass this master variable
var uid = "bindTest";
var url = "https://zimjs.com/ten/bind.php";

// from() will get any data from the url and store in Bind as data
// this will then be used as each object is bound
const b = new Bind(url, GET, uid).from(()=&gt;{

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const c = new Circle(100,red)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.loc(rand(W), rand(H))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// the bind will also set properties to existing Bind data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.bind("circle", ["x","y","level"])
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.drag();

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.on("pressup", function() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// to() will send data to the server
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.to();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.loc(rand(W-200), rand(H-200))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.bind("rect", {x:BOTH, y:BOTH, level:BOTH, alpha:TO})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.drag();

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r.on("pressup", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.to();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// b.to(); // would store random locations to start

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// would clear bindings and data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// b.removeAllBindings(true, function (response) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//     zog(response);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// });

connection - (default "zimBind") a localStorage string "example" or a URL to a server script
bindType - (default LOCALSTORAGE) or set to GET or POST
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For GET and POST a GET variable called type will be sent with either "get" or "post" value
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is captured by ZIM Base() on the PHP side and used to manage variables and responses.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LOCALSTORAGE - stores data in localStorage on the users computer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and is syncronous so all data is automatically stored on to() and from()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GET - sends data to a server script such as PHP or node using ZIM async() and JSONp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as such, this should work from local computers and across different domains
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extra information can be placed on the URL in CGI format ?prop=value&amp;prop=value
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the values (only) should be encodeURI() if spaces or special characters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is a limit of approximately 2048 characters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POST - sends data to a server using an object which gets JSON.stringify applied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this object can be retrieved via $_POST["data"] in PHP, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extra information can be placed on the URL in CGI format ?prop=value&amp;prop=value
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the values (only) should be encodeURI() if spaces or special characters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is virtually no limit to the amount of data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;files will need to be on the same server or a CORS header set up
master - (default null) information to send with each server call (not localStorage)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this could be an id, etc. and will have encodeURIComponent() applied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. in php it can be received as $_GET["master"] or $_POST["master"] depending on bindType
masterFilter - (default null) a function to run before TO and after FROM
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will receive the data (plus command and extra)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command will be "to", "fromTo", "from", or "remove" - see to(), from(), remove() for details
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and must return the data - but the function can operate on the data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. if data.id = "1_a" the filter function can set data.id = data.id.split("_").join("");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The function must return data - this will modify before sending and after receiving
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only one direction is desired use the command parameter in a conditional
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. if (command=="to") {etc.} - make sure to return the data in all cases
couple - (default false) - set to true to turn nested JSON into a single layer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object will have _ between the id and the property name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. {"circle":{"x":"10", "y":"20"},"count":{"currentValue":"0"}}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is: {"circle_x":"10", "circle_y":"20", "count_currentValue":"0"}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows data to be JSON decoded on the server
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and put more directly into table fields of the database
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The data will be automatically decoupled back to a double layer object on retrieval
smartDecimals - (default true) numbers &gt; 1 have 1 decimal, numbers &lt; 1 have two decimals
report - (default false) set to true to receive console Bind reports of each bind result
setDefault - (default null) by default the first Bind object is the zimDefaultBind object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The zimDefaultBind is what DisplayObject bind() method will use unless bindObj is specified.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the setDefault parameter to true to override any previous Bind objects as the default bind object.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See also the default property

METHODS
** all methods return the object for chaining
add(id, obj, props, extra, filter) - adds a DisplayObject (Container, Bitmap, Circle, etc.) to the Bind object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or use bind(id, props, filter, bindObj) method of DisplayObjects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will also set properties to current Bind properties for GET and POST
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or get latest data for LOCALSTORAGE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;id - a string identifier - one id per object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj - a DisplayObject (display objects can have more than one id)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props - an property as a string or an array of properties as strings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extra (default null) extra information to be sent to the server (not localStorage)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this could be an id or a search term, etc. it will have encodeURI() applied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can be received in php as $_GET["extra"] or $_POST["extra"] depending on bindType
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter - (default null) a function to run before sending and after receiving data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will receive (data, command, extra, process) parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command will be "to", "fromTo", "from", or "remove" - see to(), from(), remove() for details
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calling process.stop() will stop the current to() or from() call from proceeding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the function must return the data - see Bind masterFilter parameter for more information
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: the masterFilter if supplied will run as well before the filter
remove(targets, props, extra, filter, removeConnectionData, call) - remove a bind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;targets (default null) an object or id or an array of ids or objects to remove binds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props (default null) a property or an array of properties to remove binds on only those properties

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter (default null) a function to run before removing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will receive (data, command, extra, process) parameters - command will be "remove"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calling process.stop() will stop the current to() or from() call from proceeding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the function must return the data - see Bind masterFilter parameter for more information
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: the masterFilter and the bind filter if supplied will run as well before the filter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;removeConnectionData (default true) remove connection data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will clear removed data from localStorage for LOCALSTORAGE setting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a "remove" property will be sent to the server for GET or POST
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a JSON {id1:["prop1","prop2"], id2:["prop3"]} format of removed items
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call is a callback function after the data is sent and received
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the callback function will receive a result "success" or "error ..." in its parameter
from(call, targets, props, extra, filter) - get bind data from the connection (localStorage or database)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** accepts ZIM DUO normal parameters or configuration object literal with parameter names as propterties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from() will also send to the server a command property with the value "from" (not for localStorage)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in php this can be received as $_GET["command"] or $_POST["command"] depending on bindType
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call is a callback function after the data is received
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the callback function will receive data in its parameter of the data set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the properties of the objects are set automatically by bind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** the targets and props must have already been bound by bind.add() or obj.bind()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;targets (default null) is an object or id or array of objects or ids to receive the data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props (default null) properties to receive the data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or both targets and properties for properties of the targets to receive the data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extra (default null) extra information to be sent to the server (not localStorage)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this could be an id or a search term, etc. it will have encodeURI() applied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can be received in php as $_GET["extra"] or $_POST["extra"] depending on bindType
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter (default null) a function to run before sending and after receiving data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will receive (data, command, extra, process) parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command will be "fromTo" when sending data to server (requesting data)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command will be "from" when receiving data from the server
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calling process.stop() will stop the current to() or from() call from proceeding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the function must return the data - see Bind masterFilter parameter for more information
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: the masterFilter and the bind filter if supplied will run as well before the filter
to(targets, props, extra, filter, smartDecimals, call) - send bind data to the connection (localStorage or database)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** accepts ZIM DUO normal parameters or configuration object literal with parameter names as propterties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to() will also send to the server a command property with the value "to" (not for localStorage)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in php this can be received as $_GET["command"] or $_POST["command"] depending on bindType
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** the targets and props must have already been bound by bind.add() or obj.bind()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;targets (default null) is an object or id or array of objects or ids to send the data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props (default null) properties to send the data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or both targets and properties for properties of the targets to send the data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extra (default null) extra information to be sent to the server (not localStorage)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this could be an id or a search term, etc. it will have encodeURI() applied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can be received in php as $_GET["extra"] or $_POST["extra"] depending on bindType
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter (default null) a function to run before sending data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will receive (data, command, extra) parameters - command will be "to"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calling process.stop() will stop the current to() or from() call from proceeding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the function must return the data - see Bind masterFilter parameter for more information
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: the masterFilter and the bind filter if supplied will run as well before the filter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smartDecimals (default bind smartDecimals) override the bind smartDecimals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to true to send numbers &gt; 1 with 1 decimal or numbers &lt; 1 with 2 decimals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call is a callback function after the data is sent and received
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the callback function will receive a result in its parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;often with a success or error property or string
toUnique(targets, props, extra, filter, smartDecimals, call) - send bind data to the connection along with a unique=true variable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same as to() but sends a unqiue=true variable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unique variable can be tested for on the server
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and an appropriate resonse can be returned
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, return false if the extra variable is being used as a key and it is not unique
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In normal binding, we would want to then update
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but is some cases, we might be trying to add a unqique object to bind to in the future
toLock(targets, props, extra, filter, smartDecimals, call) - like a to() but prevents old data from being stored
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A filter with command=="from" must be used to adjust data - see below for more.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use when multiple people are appending to or updating the same JSON data object.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not use if users are simply overwriting all the data - just use a to() for that.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SCENARIO:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine that there is a bind to a TextArea() filled with user comments
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traditionally, each comment would be stored as a record (row) in the database table
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With binding, it is easier to store these as a JSON string in one record
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If two users have the JSON object at the same time and one updates the JSON object,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the second user will not receive this update so their JSON object will be out of date
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the second user sends their JSON object it will overwrite the first user's update
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first user's update will be lost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SENARIO:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine that there is a five star system that stores total stars and total voters in a JSON object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be bad for a user to initially collect this data and then twenty minutes later,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;write to this data without getting the latest data.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOLUTION:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;toLock() solves this by fetching the latest data just before a user wants to update.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This data is available in a filter when command=="from".
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DATA MUST BE MODIFIED in the filter.  Then return the modified data and
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;toLock() sends the modified data to the server.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- SERVER
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- ZIM Base should be used in the PHP code - see https://zimjs.com/base/
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- the database table should have a field called lockid of type varchar
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- in the $command=="from" the record should be locked as follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- if ($lockid) $base-&gt;setLock("table_name", $id, $lockid);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- this assumes you are updating a record with an id - this can adjusted - see ZIM Base.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** accepts ZIM DUO normal parameters or configuration object literal with parameter names as propterties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** the targets and props must have already been bound by bind.add() or obj.bind()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;targets (default null) is an object or id or array of objects or ids to send the data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props (default null) properties to send the data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or both targets and properties for properties of the targets to send the data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extra (default null) extra information to be sent to the server (not localStorage)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this could be an id or a search term, etc. it will have encodeURI() applied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can be received in php as $_GET["extra"] or $_POST["extra"] depending on bindType
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filter (default null) a function that will run three times during the process
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will receive (data, command, extra) parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the commands for the three times will be:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command "fromTo" before the from request for current data is sent and the record is locked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command "from" current data is received but before bound properties are set with current data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is here that new data can be added to or updated in the filter data object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the data object is about to be used to update the bound properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command "to" before new properties are sent to be stored and the record unlocked
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calling process.stop() will stop the current to() or from() call from proceeding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the function must return the data - see Bind masterFilter parameter for more information
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: the masterFilter and the bind filter if supplied will run as well before the filter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smartDecimals (default bind smartDecimals) override the bind smartDecimals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to true to send numbers &gt; 1 with 1 decimal or numbers &lt; 1 with 2 decimals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call is a callback function after the data is sent and received
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the callback function will receive a result in its parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;often with a success or error property or string
stop() - stops current to() or from() from running any further - sets the stopped property to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there are also process parameters provided to each filter function
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a safer way of stopping a specific bind is calling stop() on the process - process.stop()
report() - logs to the console a snapshot of the current bind data as Bind {DATA} Report:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: normally, the console shows updated data rather than static data - for instance at log time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;report() logs a zim.copy(data) which will not change in the console if the data is updated
toggleReport(state - default null) - turns on or off reports - see Bind report parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or pass in true to show reports or false to hide reports
applyData() - used internally to set object properties based on current bind data
updatefilter(id, func) - update a bind filter at an id - set func to null to remove bind filter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: the masterFilter can be adjusted with the masterFilter property
clear() - for LOCALSTORAGE, clear the localStorage[connection]
removeAllBindings(removeConnectionData, call) - removes bind data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;removeConnectionData (default true) remove connection data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will clear localStorage for LOCALSTORAGE setting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or send variable "removeAll" to connection for GET and POST
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call is a callback function after the data is sent and received
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the callback function will receive a result "success" or "error ..." in its parameter

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
data - the latest data held by bind - might not be all data depending on the last from() call parameters
connection - the localStorage string or the url for GET or POST
bindType - the type of connection LOCALSTORAGE, GET or POST
master - get or set the master data being sent with to() or from()
masterFilter - get or set the masterFilter function
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: to update the filter for a bind, noBind() and bind() with a new function
couple - get or set whether the data is coupled as sent and uncoupled as received - see couple parameter
smartDecimals - if true numbers &gt; 1 will have 1 decimal and numbers &lt; 1 will have 2 decimals
default - get or set whether this is the zimDefaultBind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the zimDefaultBind is what DisplayObject bind() method will use unless bindObj is specified
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see also the Bind setDefault parameter
stopped - setting will stop the current bind process - see stop() and filter process.stop()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: this is stopped - not stop - stop() is the method
ajax - if type is POST then this is a reference to the ZIM Ajax object being used
** the following info objects are available but relate to one another
** so adjust with care - would suggest add() and remove() to adjust
bindings - a bind info object in the format
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{id:{obj:object, props:["prop1", "prop2"]}, id2:etc.}
ids - an array of all ids
objIDs - a ZIM Dictionary of objects that holds an array of ids for each object
toIDs - an object of to() properties in the form {prop1:[id1, id2], prop2:[id3]}
fromIDs - an object of from() properties in the form {prop1:[id1, id2], prop2:[id3]}


************************************
[64712] Swipe(obj, distance, duration, isometric, overrideNoSwipe)

Swipe
zim class - extends a createjs.EventDispatcher

DESCRIPTION
Sets up capturing swipes on objects.
Dispatches a "swipe" event on swipe left, right, up, down.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const rect = new Rectangle(200, 200, blue).center();
const swipe = new Swipe(rect);
const distance = 100;
swipe.on("swipe", e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(e.swipeX); // -1, 0, 1  (for left, none and right)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(e.swipeY); // -1, 0, 1  (for up, none and down)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// move directly:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// rect.x += distance * e.swipeX;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// rect.y += distance * e.swipeY;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// S.update();

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// or animate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rect.animate({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props:{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x:rect.x+distance*e.swipeX,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y:rect.y+distance*e.swipeY
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time:.4,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ease:"quadOut"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
});

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
obj - the object you want to swipe on
distance - (default 30) the distance in pixels to activate swipe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might want to pass in a pixel distance based on percentage of stage
duration - (default .08) time in seconds to travel that distance (also see ZIM TIME constant)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try https://zimjs.com/swipe.html for testing distance and time (speed)
isometric - (default false) set to true to rotate swiping test by 30 degrees
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for swiping on ZIM game Board({isometric:true})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left-right is from top left to bottom right (cols)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top-bottom is from top right to bottom left (rows)
overrideNoSwipe - (default false) set to true to override any ZIM noSwipe settings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for example, a Slider has zimNoSwipe set on its elements so swiping the list does not swipe a page in Pages

METHODS
enable() - set swipe to active (by default it is)
disable() - set swipe to inactive (sets active to false and does not dispatch)

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
distance - the distance needed for swipe to activate
duration - the time from mousedown a swipe is measured for distance
direction - the direction of the last swipe (left, right, up, down or none)
obj - the object that was last swiped
active - Boolean true for dispatching swipes and false for not

EVENTS
dispatches a "swipe" event on every pressup (even if swipe failed and direction is none)
when a swipe event triggers
the Swipe event object has a swipeX and swipeY property that is -1,0, or 1
for left, none, or right OR up, none, down
the event object has an obj property as well for what object was swiped
also dispatches a "swipedown" event for convenience on a mousedown

LEGACY
the Swipe object provides a direction property of LEFT, RIGHT, UP, or DOWN
the Swipe object provides an obj property of what object was swiped on
for instance if e is the event object
then e.target is the Swipe object so use e.target.direction
did not dispatch a custom event due to lack of support in early IE
Swipe also dispatches a direction of "none" if the mouse movement is not a swipe
this can be used to snap back to an original location

************************************
[64895] Swiper(swipeOn, target, property, sensitivity, swiperType, min, max, damp, integer, factor, loop, pauseTime, otherSwiper)

Swiper
zim class - extends a createjs EventDispatcher

DESCRIPTION
Swiper lets you change a property of any object (with damping) by swiping.
In a sense, it is like an invisible Slider.
You pass in the DisplayObject to swipe on - stage, Container, Bitmap, etc.
You pass in which object holds the property to animate and the property name.
Then Swiper will change this property with damping based on a sensitivity you set.
You can use horizontal or vertical but to do both, you need to make two Swiper objects.
Originally made for controlling 3D objects like rotation and scale
based on swiping a rectangle beneath the 3D object that is the same color as the stage.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle(100, green).center();
// will move circle twice as fast as swipe
const swiper = new Swiper(stage, circle, "x", 2);

EXAMPLE
const man = new Rectangle(50, 100, brown).center();
// will move man up an down slowly within vertical bounds of stage
const swiper = new Swiper(man, man, "y", .5, false, 0, H-man.height);

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
swipeOn - the DisplayObject to swipe on such as the stage or a Rectangle or Bitmap, etc.
target - the object that holds the property that you want to change
property - the property name as a String to change when swiping
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: the Swiper will stop if the property value is less than .5 - this handles motion and rotation well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but if swiping for scale or alpha, etc. this may stop too soon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so set the min and max and the swiper will adjust to be one thousandth the difference between the two
sensitivity - (default 1) the change in property is equal to the change in distance times the sensitivity
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to 2 to change the property twice as fast as the swipe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to .5 to change the property half as fast as the swipe
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to .001 to change the property very little while swiping
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to -1 to go the opposite way (or -2, -.5, -.001, etc.)
swiperType - (default HORIZONTAL) or set to VERTICAL or RADIAL
min - (default null) if specified, the property value will not go below this number
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set min and max if swipe property is a small range - like for alpha or scale
max - (default null) if specified, the property value will not go above this number
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set min and max if swipe property is a small range - like for alpha or scale
damp - (default .1) the damp value with 1 being no damping and 0 being no movement
integer - (default false) set to true to round the property value
factor - (default 1) is going the same direction and -1 is going in opposite direction
loop - (default false) set to true to loop the property within the min and max values
pauseTime - (default .2) time in seconds to call swipepause event (also see ZIM TIME constant)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;triggers if no swipe motion and swipeOn is pressed
otherSwiper - (default null) pass in a second Swiper object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the change in pixels is more on the other swiper then this swiper is not used
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the change in pixels is more on this swiper then this swiper is used

METHODS
immediate(val) - set the damping immediately to this value to avoid damping to value
dispose() - remove listeners and Ticker

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
target - get or set the target for the property that you are changing
property - get or set the String property name that is being damped
desiredValue - the current value that the swiper is damping towards
sensitivity - get or set the sensitivity - see sensitivity parameter
damp - get or set the damp of the Swiper
enabled (default true) - set to false to disable the Swiper and visa versa

EVENTS
dispatches a "swipedown" event when swipe is started
dispatches a "swipemove" event when swipe is moving
dispatches a "swipeup" event when swipe is ended
dispatches a "swipepause" event when finger is not swiping but still down - see pauseTime parameter
dispatches a "swipestop" event when swipeup has happened and value has stopped changing (delay is due to damp)

MotionController
zim class - extends a createjs EventDispatcher

DESCRIPTION
MotionController lets you control an object (target) in a container (like the stage)
with "mousedown", "mousemove", "keydown", "gamebutton", "gamestick" or "manual" modes (types)
For instance, you can control a player in a game or a butterfly in field
SEE: https://zimjs.com/controller for more examples
SEE: https://zimjs.com/explore/sidescroller.html for keyboard work with Scroller, Sprite, Dynamo, Accelerator
SEE: https://zimjs.com/pen or https://zimjs.com/genpen (complex example)

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle(40, green).center();
const controller = new MotionController(circle); // circle moves to mouse press position with damping

EXAMPLE
const rect = new Rectangle(50, 30, green).centerReg();
const controller = new MotionController({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;target:rect,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type:"keydown",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diagonal:true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;damp:.1,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rotate:true
});

EXAMPLE
new MotionController({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;target:new Pen().addTo(),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type:"pressmove",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;damp:.5, // pen has damp too so can up this number
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speed:20
});

EXAMPLE
const background = new Pic("background.png").addTo(); // assuming loaded in Frame
const ball = new Circle().centerReg();
const scroller = new Scroller(background);
const accelerator = new Accelerator(scroller);

// control speed of Accelerator with MotionController
new MotionController({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;target:accelerator,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type:"mousemove", // or "pressmove"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;axis:HORIZONTAL,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// the Scroller makes two backings - backing1 and backing2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// allow pressing on both backings and ball to control scroller
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mousedownIncludes:[scroller.backing1, scroller.backing2, ball],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speed:30,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minPercentSpeed:-1000,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maxPercentSpeed:1000,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boundary:new Boundary(0,0,W,0) // setting a boundary and speed will balance the control
});

// control position of ball with MotionController
new MotionController({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;target:ball,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type:"mousemove",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// allow press on Scroller backings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mousedownIncludes:[scroller.backing1, scroller.backing2],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speed:10
});

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
target (default null) - the object you want to control
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;example a circle to move across the stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can also be an Accelerator() to control percentSpeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you only want data from the MotionController you can leave the target parameter as null (don't include it)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be a Pen() - both pen and motionController have damp parameter so probably adjust one or the other to 1
type - (default "mousedown") by default will move to where you press in the container
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to "mousemove" to have the target follow the mouse movement
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to "pressmove" to have target jump to mousedown position then follow while pressing - good for Pen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to "pressdrag" to have target follow mouse if pressed on and then dragged (dedicated to Shan Ruan)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to "keydown" to use keys to control the target (see map parameter)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to "gamebutton" to use gamepad buttons to control the target (see map parameter)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to "gamestick" to use gamepad stick(s) to control the target (see map parameter)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to "swipe" to use swipe to control the target
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to "follow" to mousedown and hold and use F.follow() to keep moving towards mouse or press position
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to "manual" to set your own with myController.convert() or myController.x and myController.y properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to a ZIM DPad object to use the DPad to control the motion
speed - (default 7 or 20 if type is pressmove) pixels it will move each tick, keypress buttonpress, swipe, etc.
axis - (default BOTH or HORIZONTAL if target is Accelerator) or HORIZONTAL or VERTICAL (see diagonal parameter)
boundary - (default null) a ZIM Boundary object for the boundary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the registration point of the target will stay within this boundary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this boundary is relative to the stage (global)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the boundary object is a Blob, the target will stay within the Blob
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a boundary relative to the object's parent is desired then set the localBoundary parameter to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the boundary is automatically added to mousedownIncludes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ignored when target is Accelerator - use minPercentSpeed and maxPercentSpeed instead
map - (default null) an Array with left, right, up, down values (or array of values) as outlined below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- (default [[65,37], [68,39], [87,38], [83,40]] when type == "keydown") these are ADWS and arrows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- (default [14, 15, 12, 13] when type == "gamebutton") these are DPAD_LEFT, DPAD_RIGHT, DPAD_UP, DPAD_DOWN on a gamepad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- (default [14, 15, 7, 6] when type == "gamebutton" and firstPerson == true) these are DPAD_LEFT, DPAD_RIGHT, RT, LT on a gamepad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- (default [0, 0, 1, 1] when type == "gamestick") these are LSX, LSX, LSY, LSY on a gamepad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- (default [[0,2], [0,2], [1], [1]] when type == "gamestick" and firstPerson == true) turn with left or right stick X, advance with left stick Y
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use [[0,2], [0,2], [1,3], [1,3]] for both sticks (first stick motion overrides second stick)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: MotionController will only use the 0 and the 2 index for speed as the sticks use -1 to 1 values
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so you could not go only left with one stick and only right with another
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: stick values may exceed -1 and 1 on occasion (see also stickThreshold)
diagonal - (default true) set to false to lock movement to horizontal or vertical only
damp - (default .1 or .5 if type is pressmove) the damp value with 1 being no damping and 0 being no movement
flip - (default null) set to HORIZONTAL, VERTICAL or BOTH to flip the target when in negative direction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flip will not work if the target starts rotated - so make the target a container and add a rotated object to the container
orient - (default false) set to true to face the direction of motion.  Start direction is 0 which is to the right.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for example, a default ZIM Triangle points up so use triangle.rot(90)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before adding to the motionController to make it point to the right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that a target that is rotated will not pay attention to the flip parameter - see flip for solution.
constant - (default false) set to true to remove keyup or gamebutton up and always move in direction last key or button press
firstPerson - (default false) set to true for keydown, gamebutton and gamecontroller to go to first person mode
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in firstPerson, the direction starts facing up and by default up arrow is speed forward and left and right change rotation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speed will be damped by damp parameter - also, map parameter changes if in firstPerson mode - see map parameter
turnSpeed - (default speed*.4) - the speed for turning in firstPerson mode - will be damped but damp parameter
moveThreshold - (default 5) pixels negative or positive to treat damped motion as stopped
stickThreshold - (default .2) gamepad stick axes values are from -1 to 1 but there is a lot of noise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so consider within +- stickThreshold as no motion 0
container - (default zimDefaultFrame stage) the Container the target is in - the stage is most likely fine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if container is specified, it must be on the stage when the MotionController is made
localBoundary - (default false) which means the boundary is global - set to true for a boundary in the object parent frame
mouseMoveOutside - (default true) set to false to not allow mouse movement outside the stage to affect motion
mousedownIncludes - (default null) a single object or array of objects (aside from the stage) to activate with mousedown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For mousedown and pressmove types, the mousedown will activate on the stage only
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The controller assumes everything in the container will not activate the mousedown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This lets you activate interface elements without moving to them ;-)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If for instance, a backing is used other than the stage, just pass in the backing to this parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See also the mousedownIncludes property and mousedownExcludes parameter and property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boundary is automatically added to mousedownIncludes
mousedownExcludes - (default null) an array of objects that the mousedown will not work on - overrides mousedownIncludes
minPercentSpeed - (default 0) if target is an Accelerator, the percentSpeed at the left or top of the stage (depending on axis)
minPercentSpeed - (default 100) if target is an Accelerator, the percentSpeed at the right or bottom of the stage (depending on axis)
dampKeyup - (default .3) damping applied to slow down Accelerator with keydown
rotate - (depreciated) the same as orient - kept for backwards compatibility as of ZIM Cat 01

METHODS
pause(state, time) - state defaults to true and pauses the motionController (sets speed to 0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set state to false to unpause the motionController (sets speed to speed before pausing)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set the time (default 0) to the seconds to take while slowing the motionController to 0 speed (also see ZIM TIME constant)
immediate(x, y) - set the damping immediately to this value to avoid damping to value - returns object for chaining
convert(x, y) - for manual mode, pass in x and y and damping and rotation will be calculated
dispose() - remove listeners and Ticker, Swiper and GamePad, where applicable

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
target - the target that you are controlling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;target.x and target.y will give you damped x and y
x - the desired x position of the target before damping is applied (use this for manual input - or convert() method)
y - the desired y position of the target before damping is applied (use this for manual input - or convert() method)
dirX - the x direction the player is moving (-1,0,1)
dirY - the y direction the player is moving (-1,0,1)
rotation - read only rotation of the player in degrees
scaleX - read only scaleX of player (to get flip data if only using controller for data)
scaleY - read only scaleY of player (to get flip data if only using controller for data)
dampX - reference to the horizonal Damp object
dampY - reference to the vertical Damp object
dampKeyup - get or set keyup damping for when using an accelerator
paused - read only - true if paused and false if not - must be set with pause() method
speed - the speed setting which will be multiplied by direction

boundary - get or set the Boundary object
gamepad - reference to GamePad object if applicable - allows you to use this for more events like jumping, shooting, etc.
moveThreshold - the maximum value (+-) within which movement is considered stopped
stickThreshold - the maximum value (+-) within which the gamepad stick axes values are considered 0
mousedownIncludes - an array of objects that the mousedown will work on - along with the stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: if manually setting this and there is a boundary then add the boundary to the mousedownIncludes as well
enabled - set to false to disable or true to enable MotionController - can toggle with enabled = !enabled

ALSO: adds a motionController property to target referencing the MotionController object

EVENTS
dispatches a "change" event for changes in direction with dir as property of event object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that will hold LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, null (no direction)
dispatches a "mousedown" event if type is "mousedown" or "pressmove"
dispatches a "pressing" event if type is "pressmove" - note, this dispatches even if not moving
dispatches a "moving" event if target is moving and "startmoving" and "stopmoving" events


************************************
[66134] GamePad()

GamePad
zim class - extends a createjs EventDispatcher

DESCRIPTION
GamePad connects to Game Controllers as inputs using the HTML navigator.getGamepads API
Dispatches buttondown and buttonup events for the following common buttons:

"A","B","X","Y", (or for Triangle, Circle, Cross and Square)
"LB","RB","LT","RT", (for left bumper, right bumper, left trigger, right trigger)
"BACK","START",
"LS","RS", (for left stick press, right stick press)
"DPAD_UP","DPAD_DOWN","DPAD_LEFT","DPAD_RIGHT"

The event object will have a button property telling which button is pressed using the string values above
Dispatches a "data" event constantly to get axes data for the sticks (and constant data for the buttons)
The event object in this case will have axes and buttons properties
The axes property is an array of four numbers for the left and right stick's x and y properies (-1 to 1)

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const gamepad = new GamePad();
gamepad.on("buttondown", e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// only fires once per button press (unlike constant keydown event)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(e.button); // LT for instance for Left trigger
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (e.button == "LT") {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog("left trigger is down");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(e.buttonCode); // 6
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (e.buttonCode == GamePad.LT) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog("another way to do catch left trigger down");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
});

gamepad.on("buttonup", e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(e.button); // LT for instance for Left trigger
}

gamepad.on("data", e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// fires constantly in a requestAnimationFrame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(e.axes[0]); // left stick x or horizontal data from -1 to 1 (lots of decimal noise)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(e.axes[GamePad.LTX]); // another way of accessing left stick x
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(e.buttons[9]); // true or false depending on if the START button is pressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(e.buttons[GamePad.START]); another way to find if the START button is pressed
});

METHODS
dispose() - removes all listeners and cancels requestAnimationFrame

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
connected - Boolean true if connected and false if not connected (may need to press key, etc)
currentIndex - get or set the index of the controller
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gives multiple controller support - make two GameController objects and set different indexes
data - object that holds buttons (raw data - slightly different than buttons below) and axes properties
buttons - an array of Booleans as to whether the button is pressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the order of the buttons match the order of the constants below
constants: A,B,X,Y,LB,RB,LT,RT,BACK,START,LS,RS,DPAD_UP,DPAD_DOWN,DPAD_LEFT,DPAD_RIGHT
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GamePad.A == 0
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GamePad.B == 1, etc. up to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GamePad.DPAD_RIGHT == 15
axes - an array of four stick values from -1 to 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for left x and y and right x and y values (or horizontal and vertical values)
constants: LSX,LSY,RSX,RSY
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GamePad.LSX == 0
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GamePad.LSY == 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GamePad.RSX == 2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GamePad.RSY == 3

EVENTS
dispatches a "gamepadconnected" and gamepaddisconnected when connected and disconnected
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these have an event object with index and id properties - the index and id may not work in chrome
dispatches a "buttondown" event with button and buttonCode properties
dispatches a "buttonup" event with button and buttonCode properties
dispatches a "data" event with axes and buttons array properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these can be handled as outlined in the description and examples


************************************
[66301] Portal(obj, lands)

Portal
zim class - extends a CreateJS EventDispatcher
Dedicated to Stephen Hawkings - may he be portal on!

DESCRIPTION
Turn an object into a portal that lets the user enter the portal to change lands, etc.
The portal works based on mouseover (or press for mobile)
The lands need to be stacked in a Container with the first land at the top.
Portal will pass users throught the lands and loop at the end back to the first land.
Alternatively, if loop is turned to false, Portal will backtrack the user through the lands
Pass the container of lands into the lands parameter - most often you will have two lands, but more are fine too!
Alternatively, the portal can be used without lands - and you can customize what you want to happen with portal events.

The object will be used as a mask to show the next land.
You can set the alpha of the object to any value above .01 to hide the object and show the land (do not use 0)
If your object is a ZIM shape, you can use rgba(0,0,0,.01) as the color and still have an opaque borderColor

SEE: https://zimjs.com/portal/

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
F.loadAssets(["researchbuilding.jpg", "jungle.jpg"]);
F.on("complete", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const lands = new Container(W, H).addTo();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const jungle = new Pic("jungle.jpg")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.scaleTo(lands)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center(lands);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const researchBuilding = new Pic("researchbuilding.jpg")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.scaleTo(lands)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center(lands);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const portalObject = new Circle(118, faint, pink, 16, true)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.addTo(stage)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.pos(580, 470)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.animate({obj:{rotation:"360"}, time:70, ease:"linear", loop:true});
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const portal = new Portal(portalObject, lands);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;portal.on("enter", function() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// play a sound here!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// use enabled to turn on and off portal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timeout(1, ()=&gt;{portal.enabled = false; portalObject.pauseAnimate(true);});
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timeout(5, ()=&gt;{portal.enabled = true; portalObject.pauseAnimate(false);});

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
}); // assets loaded

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
obj - the Display Object that will be the portal
lands - (default null) optional container of "lands" or display objects to portal through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Display Objects in the lands container (lands) should be on the stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lands are adjusted by Portal so the currentLand is the second child and the nextLand is the first child.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is due to how the masking works.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inserting new lands or removing lands below an index of lands.numChildren-2 is okay
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use addTo(lands, index) or removeFrom(lands).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you adjust either of the top two lands in the container, this will affect what is see on stage.

METHODS
dispose() - remove the events - the obj and lands will be left as is - manually remove these if needed

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
portal - a reference to the portal obj
enabled - Boolean as to whether the portal is active or not
currentLand - get or set the active land if lands is provided
nextLand - get (read only) the next land to go to if lands is provided

EVENTS
dispatches an enter event on mouseover of the portal and an exit event on mouseout

[66460] Physics(gravity, borders, scroll, frame)

Physics
zim module
** MUST import zim_physics - see https://zimjs.com/es6.html#MODULES

DESCRIPTION
The Physics class provides a wrapper for the Box2D physics engine.
Both Box2D and the ZIM physics JavaScript files must be imported after ZIM.
Once installed, physics can be turned on for ZIM DisplayObjects such as:
Rectangle, Circle, Triangle, Bitmap, Label, Sprite, Shape, etc.

NOTE: The DisplayObjects used in Physics should have center registration and be on the stage
or in a non-transformed Container at 0,0 on the stage.

Use the DisplayObject's addPhysics() method to add the object to a physics world.
This will also add more methods and properties to the DisplayObject.
The physics world can be set up ahead of time with new Physics()
or if a world is not already created the addPhysics() method will make a default world.
The default world will have a boundary of the frame and gravity of 10 (normal gravity).

SHAPES
By default the physics body shape will be a rectangle that matches the bounding box of the DisplayObject.
However, a Circle will be have a physics circle and a Triangle will have a physics triangle.
"circle", "rectangle" or "triangle" can be passed in to the addPhysics() method to override the actual shape.
The expand parameter can be used to make the physics object bigger or smaller than the bounds.

PHYSICS
Objects have impulse(), force(), spin() and torque() methods to push them around and spin them.
impulse() is a one time push like shooting a pool ball
force() is a force over time like gravity or wind and is applied in a Ticker, keydown, etc.
spin() is a one time spin of the object around its center
torque() will rotate the object over time and is applied in a Ticker, keydown, etc.
The physics class has a join() method that can join objects in a variety of physics joints.
The physics class has a drag() method to specify which objects are draggable.
There is a debug() method to see the physics world behind ZIM.
The world can be set up to be bigger than the frame and follow() an object.
Objects are given a control() method to use keyboard keys to move the object.
Contact can be tested for with contact() and contactEnd()
each which receive a callback function that is provided with the other contacting body

BOX2D
https://box2d.org/documentation or
https://www.box2dflash.org/docs/2.0.2/manual
Box2D has many other features that can be accessed as well.
Note that the ZIM Physics makes much of this easier
so start with ZIM and use the Box2D docs and manuals for custom requirements.
The Physics class has a world poperty that refers to the Box2D world.
Each ZIM DisplayObject with physics() turned on has a body property
that refers to the Box2D body and a physics property that refers to its Physics object.
See the properties listed below for more information.

SEE: https://zimjs.com/physics/ for examples

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// add a rectangle to a default Physics world,
// set it draggable and turn debug mode on
const rect = new Rectangle().centerReg().addPhysics(); // center registration for rectangular objects
rect.physics.drag();
rect.physics.debug();
// note: we would usually make a Physics() object first (see below)

EXAMPLE
// create a world with no gravity (viewed from top like air-hockey)
const physics = new Physics(0);
const circle = new Circle(50,blue,grey).center().addPhysics({restitution:1.1}); // how bouncy
// make sure to reg(CENTER) or centerReg() any rectangular objects
const rect = new Rectangle(30,400).reg(CENTER).pos(70).addPhysics(false); // static - do not move
const tri = new Triangle(150,150,150,green,grey).center().pos(200).addPhysics({linear:10});
physics.drag(); // note: to add a boundary use the border parameter of Physics()
// test to see if circle hits rectangle
// contact callback function receives ZIM object (and physics body as next param)
// a ZIM border will have a type = "Border" and a side = LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, "bottom"
// but it is not really a ZIM Rectangle but just an object literal placeholder
circle.contact(obj=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (obj == rect) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rect.color = red;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timeout(.3, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rect.color = black;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// circle.noContact(); // could only check once...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;})
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
});

EXAMPLE
// control a ball with a DPad - better than keys for mobile
const physics = new Physics(0);
const ball = new Circle().center().addPhysics();
const dPad = new DPad().pos(40,40,LEFT,BOTTOM);
ball.control(dPad, 80);

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all three support ZIM DUO single parameter as an object using param names as keys
remove(body) - removes a physics body - use on border bodies, for instance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is for physics bodies only - use obj.removePhysics() to remove physics from ZIM DisplayObjects
addMap(body, asset) - sets x, y, rotation of ZIM asset to Box2D body
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can be automatically done by using the physics() method on the ZIM DisplayObject
removeMap(body) - removes mapping (then probably will want to remove body and removeChild)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see the removePhysics() method of a ZIM DisplayObject
dispose() - stops the update, removes debug if there - you still need to remove ZIM assets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a delay of 50 ms might be needed before disposing children to let the physics dispose
*** also see zim.Ticker below for methods to add and remove functions from update function

PROPERTIES - FOR PHYSICS - see also OBJECT PROPERTIES and BODY PROPERTIES below
world - the Box2D world that is made
frame - the Frame the physics is operating on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see: https://zimjs.com/expand/physics.html for example
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: will have to call drag() again if changing frames
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: may have to redo borders if frame has different dimensions
scale (read only) scale used in world (constant 30)
step (read only) step used in world (constant 20)
timeStep - 1/step - set to 0 to pause physics but also see paused() method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could animate this property to slow down or speed up physics
gravity - get or set gravity used in world
paused (read only) whether physics has been paused with pause() method
scroll - get or set the scroll of the physics world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see the Physics scroll parameter and the follow() method of objects
Ticker - gives access to update function to add your own functions:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;physics.Ticker.add(function, after)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after defaults to true for after world step and force clear
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set after to false to run function before world step
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;physics.Ticker.remove(function)
controlObj - the ZIM DisplayObject being controlled by the obj.control() method
followObj - the ZIM DisplayObject being followed by the obj.follow() method
borderTop - the top border physics body of the world if it exists
borderBottom - the bottom border physics body of the world if it exists
borderLeft - the left border physics body of the world if it exists
borderRight - the right border physics body of the world if it exists

METHODS - FOR OBJECTS - also see BODY METHODS below
** the ZIM DisplayObject comes with an addPhyics() method
** for reference, here are the docs for the addPhysics() method
** all the methods below addPhysics are the methods added to the DisplayObject
addPhysics(dynamic, contract, shape, friction, linear, angular, density, bounciness, maskBits, categoryBits, physics, restitution, sensor)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dynamic - (default true) - set to false to not move the physics body (static)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contract - (default 0) - make the physics body smaller (or bigger with negative) than bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shape - (default object shape) - "rectangle" for any object other than Circle, Dial and Triangle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but can specify a "circle" for a Sprite or Bitmap, for instance - to try and match shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;custom polygon bodies can also be made with manual Box2D and then use physics.addMap()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the only shapes available automatically are "rectangle", "circle", "triangle"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;friction - (default .8) - how sticky will the body act - set to 0 to slide.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;linear - (default .5) - linear damping which slows the movement - set to 0 for no damping
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angular - (default .5) - angular damping which slows the rotation - set to 0 for no damping
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;density - (default 1) - the density that can affect what happens with collisions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bounciness - (default 0) - how bouncy the object is - 0 is not bouncy 4 is crazy bouncy
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maskBits - (default null) - used with categoryBits to determine which bodies will collide with which other bodies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as soon as maskBits is specified, the body will collide only with the categoryBits provided to the maskBits parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 will collide with bodies that do not have categoryBits specified including the borders
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to test collision with bodies that have categoryBits specified, use the pipe (|) as follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1|2 will also collide with bodies having categoryBits of 2 specified
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so if another body has categoryBits of 4 then the bodies would not collide.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1|2|4 would also collide with 4 but not bodies with categoryBits of 8, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2|4 would pass through any bodies without categoryBits of 2 or 4 including the borders
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;categoryBits - (default 1) - a collision category - by default, bodies are in category 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use with maskBits to say which bodies will collide with which other bodies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the values are bit fields https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field so can have the following values:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, etc. up to 15 powers of 2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;physics - (default zimDefaultPhysics)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restitution - (default bounciness) - replaced by bounciness - kept for backwards compatibility
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sensor - (default false) - set to true to make object not interact but still trigger contact() and contactEnd()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is like the Box2D hitTest for non interaction
removePhysics() - lets you remove the DisplayObject from the physics world
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to add back to the physics world, use the addPhysics() method
impulse(x, y, targetX, targetY) - add a one-time force on the object like a hitting a pool ball
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x - (default 0) the force in the x direction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y - (default 0) the force in the y direction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;targetX - (default center of object) the x location on the object where the force acts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;targetY - (default center of object) the y location on the object where the force acts
force(x, y, targetX, targetY) - add a force over time on the object like a gravity or wind
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is applied in a new Ticker or on keydown, etc. many times
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just applying the force once will not do anything - use an impulse() for that
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x - (default 0) the force in the x direction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y - (default 0) the force in the y direction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;targetX - (default center of object) the x location on the object where the force acts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;targetY - (default center of object) the y location on the object where the force acts
spin(amount) - add a one time turning force to an object
torque(amount) - add a turning force over time on the object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is applied in a new Ticker or on keydown, etc. many times
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just applying the torque once will hardly do anything - use an spin() for that
setLinearVelocity(x, y) - set the linear velocity - this overrides current forces
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so might look unnatural as setLinearVelocity(0,0) will stop the object moving
setAngularVelocity(amount) - set the angular velocity - this overrids current forces
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so might look unnatural as setAngularVelocity(0) will stop the object spinning
sleep() - puts object to sleep so no physics calculations are done
wake() - wakes up object from sleep so physics calculations are done
follow(damp, dampY, leftOffset, rightOffset, upOffset, downOffset, offsetDamp, offsetDampY, horizontal, vertical, borderLock, borderOriginal)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moves stage to to follow ZIM object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set the scroll parameter of Physics to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass in null for obj to stop following - then can position stage with x and y
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;damp - (default .05) the damping of the motion of the stage - 1 moves faster, 0 not at all
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dampY - (default damp) can set to damp vertical movement at a separate rate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leftOffset - (default 0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rightOffset - (F.width)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the object will try and move to leftOffset when moving right and rightOffset when moving left
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this counters the damping so that the user can see in the direction of motion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the object is not being controled it moves to the average between left and right offsets
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upOffSet - (default 0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;downOffSet - (default F.height)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same as offsets above but in the y direction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offsetDamp - (default .02) the damping for moving the object to the offset
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offsetDampY - (default offsetDamp) - damping for moving the object to the y offset if desired to be different than x
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal - (default true) set to false to not follow horizontally
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vertical - (default true) set to false to not follow vertically
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;borderLock - (default true) locks follow to borders if borders are not "none"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;borderOriginal - (default false) set to true to lock follow to original borders even if removed
control(type, speed, speedY, horizontal, vertical) - control object with arrows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see noControl() to turn off object control
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type - (default "both") or set "wasd" or "arrows" or a ZIM DPad object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speed - (default 200) the speed of the object motion (also speed property on object)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speedY - (default speed) or set to specify a different y speed than the x speed (also speedY property on object)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal - (default true) set to false to not control horizontal motion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vertical - (default true) set to false to not control vertical motion
customControl(dir, speed, speedY) - available only if control() is set.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass in LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN and optional speed (otherwise uses control() speed)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for operating object with buttons or accelerometer for instance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these will then take the place of keys or DPad
noControl() - remove control for an object set with control()
contact(call) - run the call function when object's body contacts another body
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the callback function receives two parameters - the ZIM object and the Physics body that the object has hit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a border will have a type = "Border" and a side = LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, "bottom"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is not really a ZIM Rectangle but just an object literal placeholder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also see sensor parameter to trigger contact but with no physics interaction
contactEnd(call) - run the call function when object's body ends contacts with another body
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the callback function receives two parameters - the ZIM object and the Physics body that the object has hit
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a border will have a type = "Border" and a side = LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, "bottom"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is not really a ZIM Rectangle but just an object literal placeholder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also see sensor parameter to trigger contact but with no physics interaction
noContact() - remove contact call
noContactEnd() - remove contactEnd call

PROPERTIES - FOR OBJECTS - see also BODY PROPERTIES below
dynamic - set to true for dynamic and false for static
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is also kinematic that can be set using the obj.body.SetType(1)
speed - get or set the speed of an object that is controlled by control()
speedY - get or set the speedY of an object that is controlled by control()
** normal x, y, rotation or pos(), loc(), rot() will not work with physics!
** see the BODY PROPERTIES below for x, y and rotation
** these should really not be set at all in the physics world
** but rather let the forces, etc. work them out
** it is best to set traditional properties before calling physics()

METHODS - FOR BODY (a phsyics engine body)
** the ZIM DisplayObject body property provides access to the following Box2D methods (note, all start with uppercase):
** commonly used methods are handled through ZIM wrapper methods on the DisplayObject
** see http://www.box2dflash.org/docs/2.1a/reference/ for very basic docs

PROPERTIES - FOR BODY (a phsyics engine body)
zimObj - the ZIM Object that the body is mapped to
** traditional properties should be set before calling phyics()
** but the following properties are provided
x - the x position of the body - setting this will also position of the ZIM DisplayObject

[66956] TimeLine(objects, width, startPaused, barColor, buttonColor, themeColor, corner, ticks, damp, loop, noLoop, call, style, group, inherit)

TimeLine
zim class extends zim Container which extends a createjs Container

DESCRIPTION
Automatically adds a ZIM Silder that scrubs through animations added to the Timeline.
There is a play and pause and a menu with speed, labels, loop, trails and color settings.
This will most-likely be used for learning - for testing animations, etc.
The pop-up menu button can be removed with timeline.menu.removeFrom();
The menu can be cleared with timeline.pane.contentContainer.removeAllChildren();
Or the menu can customized with timeline.pane.add(someObject);

SEE: https://zimjs.com/015/timeline.html

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const icon = F.makeIcon({box:clear })
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.reg(CENTER)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.loc(150,450)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.alp(0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.sca(0)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props:{rotation:90},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rewind:true,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loop:true
});

const path = new Squiggle({showControls:false}).transformPoints("scale", 2).pos(0,100,CENTER);
new Circle(50,red).addTo().rot(90).animate({path:path},4)

new Timeline(); // note, the Timeline will be automatically added at the bottom

[67373] BlurEffect(blurX, blurY, quality, style, group, inherit)

BlurEffect
zim class extends createjs BlurFilter

DESCRIPTION
Blurs a DisplayObject in the x and/or y direction with a quality
Can be passed in to effect() method to apply effect.
Properties can be changed and updated and then updateEffects() called.
Properties can be animated and wiggled.
Use noEffect("blur") to remove blur effect.

SEE: https://zimjs.com/cat/effects.html

NOTE: Effects are quite processor intensive so use sparingly.
Each effect processes every pixel - when animating this results in hundreds of thousands of loops.
ZIM has wrapped the CreateJS filters, filter property, caching and cacheUpdate system
to make accessing filters easy - but apps will slow down if they are over-used.
Keep the quality at 1 for animating filters at a decent framerate.
Consider pre-processing images if effects do not have to be dynamic.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// add a blur effect then remove it after 2 seconds
const rect = new Rectangle()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.effect(new BlurEffect(20, 20));
timeout(2, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rect.noEffect();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// // or if other effects to keep use:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// rect.noEffect("blur");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// // or to update effect use:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// rect.effects.blur.blurY = 200;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// rect.updateEffects();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// // can also store effect in variable and access properties on the variable
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// // rather than on the effects property of the object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

EXAMPLE
// add a 200 blurX effect and animate it to 0 rewind and looping
STYLE = {blurX:200} // just showing using style...
new Pic("image.png") // preloaded asset
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.effect(new BlurEffect())
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.animate({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props:{"effects.blur.blurX":0},

** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
blurX - |ZIM VEE| (default 10) the blur in the x
blurY - |ZIM VEE| (default 10) the blur in the y
quality - |ZIM VEE| (default 1) the number of effect iterations
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A value of 2 will produce a smoother effect, but take twice as long to run, etc.
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly


METHODS
clone(exact) - clone the effect - set exact to true to match the ZIM VEE values exactly on cloning
ALSO See the CreateJS Easel Docs for Filter methods, such as: getBounds()

PROPERTIES
** a reference to the effect object is also avalailable as obj.effects.blur
** after setting these properties call obj.updateEffects()
** animate() and wiggle() do this automatically
blurX - the blur in the x
blurY - the blur in the y

Can be passed in to effect() method to apply effect.
Properties can be changed and updated and then updateEffects() called.
Properties can be animated and wiggled.
Use noEffect("shadow") to remove shadow effect.

SEE: https://zimjs.com/cat/effects.html

NOTE: ZIM sha() wraps a CreateJS Shadow() which seems to put shadow on borders too
The ShadowEffect() does not put shadows on borders - which is good.

NOTE: Effects are quite processor intensive so use sparingly.
Each effect processes every pixel - when animating this results in hundreds of thousands of loops.
ZIM has wrapped the CreateJS filters, filter property, caching and cacheUpdate system
to make accessing filters easy - but apps will slow down if they are over-used.
Keep the quality at 1 for animating filters at a decent framerate.
Consider pre-processing images if effects do not have to be dynamic.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// add a shadow effect when dragging and remove on pressup
const rect = new Rectangle()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.drag();
rect.on("mousedown", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rect.effect(new ShadowEffect());
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});
rect.on("pressup", function () {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rect.noEffect("shadow");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});

[68048] ColorEffect(redMultiplier, greenMultiplier, blueMultiplier, alphaMultiplier, redOffset, greenOffset, blueOffset, alphaOffset, style, group, inherit)

ColorEffect
zim class extends createjs ColorFilter

DESCRIPTION
Changes the colors in a DisplayObject including Shapes and Bitmaps.

BACKGROUND
Bitmaps are made up of four channels - red, green, blue and alpha (transparency).
Each channel has 256 values from 0 to 255.
O is dark and 255 is light.
If we multiply the blue channel by 0 we would get no blue colors.
If we multiply the blue channel by .5 we would get half as bright blue colors
and multiplying by 1 would leave the blue colors as they are.
Offsetting the colors negative makes them darker and positive makes them lighter.

SEE: hue, saturation, brightness and contrast DisplayObject properties as well

SEE: the keyOut() method of Bitmap(), Pic() and SVG() that has a replacement color parameter

SEE: color property of Shapes or backgroundColor property of Components
to change colors directly including animating color from one color to another with animate()

Can be passed in to effect() method to apply effect.
Properties can be changed and updated and then updateEffects() called.
Properties can be animated and wiggled.
Use noEffect("color") to remove color effect.

SEE: https://zimjs.com/cat/effects.html

NOTE: Effects are quite processor intensive so use sparingly.
Each effect processes every pixel - when animating this results in hundreds of thousands of loops.
ZIM has wrapped the CreateJS filters, filter property, caching and cacheUpdate system
to make accessing filters easy - but apps will slow down if they are over-used.
Keep the quality at 1 for animating filters at a decent framerate.
Consider pre-processing images if effects do not have to be dynamic.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

These are easier to use than the MultiEffect class directly.

Can be passed in to effect() method to apply effect.
Properties can be changed and updated and then updateEffects() called.
Properties can be animated and wiggled.
Use noEffect("hue") to remove hue effect.

************************************
[68353] AlphaEffect(mask, style, group, inherit)

AlphaEffect
zim class extends createjs AlphaMaskFilter

DESCRIPTION
Applies an alpha mask to a DisplayObject

BACKGROUND
Images have an alpha channel with values from 0-255
with 0 being completely see through and 255 completely opaque.

A regular mask shows the masked object through the mask
where the mask has any alpha greater than 0.
And a regular mask in ZIM needs to be a Shape.

When the AlphaEffect() is applied to a target object
it sets the alpha of the target object
to the alpha of the mask passed in to the effect.
It replaces the alpha channel of the object with the alpha channel of the mask.
The mask can be a PNG with varying levels of alpha
or a shape with a gradient alpha using an rgba() color.
This means we can fade the edges of the image!

Can be passed in to effect() method to apply effect.
Properties can be changed and updated and then updateEffects() called.
Properties can be animated and wiggled.
Use noEffect("alpha") to remove alpha effect.

************************************
[68471] Pixel(obj, amount, amountY, blur, dynamic, blendmode, boundary, expand, amountFactor, blurFactor, style, group, inherit)

Pixel
zim class extends ZIM Bitmap which extends CreateJS Bitmap

DESCRIPTION
Uses raw canvas processing to pixilate a Display Object.
This is not a pixel by pixel process like the ZIM Effects (BlurEffect, GlowEffect, etc.)
So the speed is very fast.
The Display Object is cached, scaled down and scaled back up with image smoothing disabled.
The scaling proceedure is actually faster than scaling with image smoothing turned on.
This effect has been available on the canvas all along, ZIM Pixel makes it easier to use.

SEE:
https://zimjs.com/zim/pixel.html
https://zimjs.com/zim/pixel2.html

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// pixelate a Circle
const circle = new Pixel(new Circle(200,red)).center().drag();

EXAMPLE
F.color = darker;
function makePixel() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return new Pixel(new Circle(40,[pink,blue,purple]),.3)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.alp(.5)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.reg(CENTER);

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}).center();

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
obj - |ZIM VEE| (default Tile of Circles) the object to pixilate - the original will still exist.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in theory, this can be any DisplayObject such as a Circle(), Button(), Container(), asset(), etc.
amount - |ZIM VEE| (default .5) the amount to pixelate from 0-1.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the granularity depends on the amountFactor which is also from 0-1.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at a lower amountFactor, the 0-1 amount will focus on smaller pixilations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at a higher amountFactor, the 0-1 amount will focus on bigger pixilations.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if an amountY is set then this will be the amountX
amountY - |ZIM VEE| (default 0) the amount to pixelate in the vertical. Also see amount.
blur - |ZIM VEE| (default 0) the amount to blur (0-1) the image before pixilating (this is a scaling blur so fast)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see blurFactor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set blurFacter low to concentrate blur on smaller amounts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set blurFactor high to concentrate blur on larger amounts
dynamic - (default false) set to true if changing the object the original object that is being pixelated
blendmode - |ZIM VEE| (default null) the blendmode to apply when updating Pixel
boundary - (default obj.getBounds()) the boundary for the caching - use a ZIM Boundary() object, etc.
expand - (default 0) an amount of pixels to expand the boundary by (or contract if negative)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be a number for all sides, an array of [left/right, top/bottom] or [left,top,right,bottom]
amountFactor - |ZIM VEE| (default .6) the range (0-1) to concentrate the amount parameter on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a lower value will concentrate amount on smaller pixels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a higher value will concentrate amount on larger pixels
blurFactor - |ZIM VEE| (default .6) the range (0-1) to concentrate the blur parameter on
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a lower value will concentrate blur on smaller amounts
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a higher value will concentrate blur on larger amounts
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
update() - update the Pixel Bitmap if the object changes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if dynamic parameter is set to true there is no need to update()
clone(exact) - clone the effect - set exact to true to match the ZIM VEE values exactly on cloning
dispose() - clear any update Ticker and dispose the Bitmap

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:

************************************
[68790] Parallax(layers, damp, auto, stage, startPaused, mouseMoveOutside, clamp)

Parallax
zim class

DESCRIPTION
Takes objects as layers and sets properties based on an input,
for instance, each layer could move a different x based on position of mouseX
or each layer could scale a different amount based on scroll of y.
The types of input are mouseX, mouseY, scrollX, scrollY or custom.
The types of properties to change could be x, y, scaleX, scaleY, rotation, alpha, frameNumber, etc.
Parallax allows scale to be a property which scales scaleX and scaleY together.
Parallax allows frame to be a property and calls gotoAndStop() on a Sprite frame.
Parallax really just manages multiple ProportionDamp objects.
For proper parallax, the objects closer move more than the objects farther back.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// make assets to move around
// these could be pictures, shapes, containers, etc.
const backing = new Rectangle(800, 200, "yellow").center();
const mid = new Rectangle(400, 200, "green").center().mov(0,20);
const front = new Circle(60, red).center().mov(0,80);

// make Parallax object - here we move with stage mouseX and mouseY
const parallax = new Parallax([
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{obj:backing, prop:"x", propChange:50}, {obj:backing, prop:"y", propChange:40, input:"mouseY"},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{obj:mid, prop:"x", propChange:100}, {obj:mid, prop:"y", propChange:80, input:"mouseY"},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{obj:front, prop:"x", propChange:150}, {obj:front, prop:"y", propChange:100, input:"mouseY"}

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
layers - (default null) an array of layer objects, the format as below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: to move an obj 200 px in the x as the window scrolls from 100 to 300 px in the y
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[{obj:obj, prop:"x", propChange:200, input:"scrollY", inMin:100, inMax:300, factor:1, integer:false}, etc.]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj - the object whose property is being changed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prop - the property that is being changed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;propChange - how much you want the property to change
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;input - (default mouseX) but can also be mouseY, scrollX, scrollY
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inMin - (default 0) minimum input range
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inMax - (default W (for x prop) H (for y prop)) maximum input range
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;factor - (default 1) set factor to -1 to change in the opposite direction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integer - (default false) set to true to round the value to an integer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;split - (default true for mouseX, false for others) centers input so half output is on one side and half on the other
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immediate - (default null) set to a value to set property immediately take that value without damping from current property value
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example 2: a traditional mouse move parallax for one object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[{obj:obj, prop:"x", propChange:100}, {obj:obj, prop:"y", propChange:50, input:"mouseY"}, etc.]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you would probably have more objects to follow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or you can add these one at a time with the p.addLayer({layer object properties});
damp - (default .1) the damp value with 1 being no damping and 0 being no movement
auto - (default true) uses the specified input
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if auto is set to false, you must make your own new Ticker and use the step(input) method
stage - (default the default frame's stage) the stage - specify this if multiple stages
startPaused - (default false) set to true to start parallax paused - set paused(false) to unpause it
mouseMoveOutside - (default true) set to false to not allow mouse movement outside the stage to affect motion
clamp - (default true) set to false to allow range outside min and max
NOTE: ticker and fps parameters have been removed - see zim.Ticker to set

METHODS
addLayer({layer object properties}) - adds a layer - returns object for chaining
removeLayer(index) - removes a layer based on order added - returns object for chaining
step(input) - used when auto is false to send in custom input data - returns object for chaining
immediate([]) - an array of inputs for each layer used to immediately set the target value with no damping - returns object for chaining
pause(state) - pauses or unpauses the parallax - state defaults to true - see also startPaused - returns object for chaining
dispose() - removes listeners

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
damp - allows you to dynamically change the damping
paused - read-only boolean whether the parallax is paused - see pause() and startPaused property

[69080] Flipper(front, back, interactive, time, vertical, flipped, ease, frontPress, backPress, reverse, continuous, style, group, inherit)

Flipper
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Flipper lets you flip between two DisplayObjects.
It has a back and a front that can be any display object.  You press it and it flips.
The flip() method allows you to programmatically flip it or pass in true or false to flip on or off.
A flipped property tells you if it is flipped.
There is a "flip" event for when it starts to flip and a "flipped" event for when it is done flipping.

See: https://zimjs.com/cat/flipper.html
See: https://zimjs.com/elearning/match.html
See: https://codepen.io/zimjs/pen/LYRxprK

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
STYLE = {borderColor:dark, borderWidth:2};
const front = F.makeIcon().sca(2.5);
const back = new Page(front.width, front.height, blue, green, 1);
const Label("ZIM Flipper").center(back);
const card = new Flipper(front, back).center();

EXAMPLE
const page1 = new Page(400,600,red,purple);
// Find emoji and paste from here
// https://emojipedia.org/clockwise-vertical-arrows/

************************************
[69316] Book(width, height, pages, startPage, rollUp, radius, backgroundColor, arrows)

Book
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Creates a book with pages that flip like a real book.
The user can flip pages by dragging the pages or using the arrows.
The pages can be turned with code using nextPage() and prevPage() methods
and specific pages can be turned to with the gotoPage() method.

The pages are passed in as an array and can include interactivity.

Book is different than ZIM Pages which have transitions and do not "flip".

See: https://zimjs.com/cat/book.html
See: https://zimjs.com/five/book.html - for a simple book of images made in five minutes!
See: https://zimjs.com/darklo - an example with SLam DarkLo pottery.

NOTE: Book might need a last page on the right to work properly
if that is the case just add an extra blank page with F.color if needed.

NOTE: Using horizontal pages currently makes the page turning glitchy - will look into it soon - Feb 23, 2023

NOTE: do not use transparent pages or the book workings will be revealed

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// The pages in the book can be fully interactive
// but here is an example of just loading images into the book
// note - import ZIM and CreateJS in a script file above
// copy the template from https://zimjs.com/code.html

const path = "covers/"; // the folder with the images
const assets = ["build.jpg", "castle.jpg", "ganymede.jpg", "lastyear.jpg", "martian.jpg"];
new Frame(FIT, 1024, 768, darker, darker, ready, assets, path);
function ready() {

// get one picture to find the size of the book
const pic = new Pic("build.jpg");
new Book(pic.width*2, pic.height, assets).center();

} // end of ready

EXAMPLE
STYLE = {width:W/2, color:series(blue, pink, yellow, green)};
// add anything you want to each of these Pages
const page1 = new Page();
const page2 = new Page();
const page3 = new Page();
const page4 = new Page();
const pages = [page1, page2, page3, page4];
// 0 (default) will show only page 0 at right - like a cover
// 1 will show page 0 and page 1 to start - like an open book
new Book(W, H, pages, 1).addTo();

EXAMPLE
// to remove interactivity remove the stage and frame events
// these get added in a slight delay, so remove them in a slight delay
timeout(.1, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.off("stagemousedown", book.stageEvent);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.off("keydown", book.keydown);
});

// to add the interactivity again use:
book.stageEvent = S.on("stagemousedown", book.stageEvent);
book.keydown = F.on("keydown", book.keydown);
// (note, the events are reassigned to the properties)

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
width - (default zimDefaultFrame width) the width of the book (including both sides)
height - (default zimDefaultFrame height) the height of the book
pages - an array of DisplayObjects to show as pages
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or pass in an asset string - for instance an image to show an image
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these images can be preloaded with the asset parameter of Frame
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not use transparent pages or the book workings will be revealed
startPage - (default 0) 0 will start with a "cover" at right.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting this to 1 will start with no "cover" but rather a left page and a right page showing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting to 2 will have a "cover" but initially show page 1 and 2 (not the cover), etc.
rollUp - (default 1) seconds before showing a corner hint - set to false to not show the corner
radius - (default false) pages will use full page to drag unless a radius is set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then the drag corner will be available at the radius distance from the bottom corners
backgroundColor - (default clear) the backing color of the book (if first or last page is a single page)
arrows - (default true (.2 seconds)) set to true or the number of seconds for arrows to turn page.  See also ZIM TIME constant

METHODS
nextPage(time) - animate the page to the next page at provided time in seconds (default .1).  See also ZIM TIME constant
prevPage(time) - animate the page to the previous page at provided time in seconds (default .1).  See also ZIM TIME constant
gotoPage(num, time) - animate to a page at provided time in seconds (default .1).  See also ZIM TIME constant
changeFrame(frame) - use this method if book is moved to another frame
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:

addChild(), removeChild(), addChildAt(), getChildAt(), contains(), removeAllChildren(), etc.

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
page - get or set the index number of page - will animate at a .1 speed (see gotoPage())
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when asked for this will be the right hand page index
pageNext - get the next page if rollPress has triggered (see rollPress event)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the next page is the right hand page index
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so if going right, not actually the next page but one more
directPage - get or set the index number of a page - will NOT animate in going to the page
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: the book must be on the stage (or in a container on the stage) before using this property
direction - get the direction the page is animating to - either LEFT or RIGHT
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or if asked for on roll events will tell LEFT or RIGHT side
lastPage - get the index number of the page that was just animated (available in page event)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: pages may skip by 2
pages - read only array of pages - this are the original pages array passed in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: at this time, the Book must be remade to add or remove pages
moving - get whether the page is being animated

************************************
[69979] Scrambler(tile, keys, keyProperty, scramble, time, wait, num, shadowColor, shadowBlur, swap, swapLock, style, group, inherit)

Scrambler
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
Takes a ZIM Tile and scrambles its items allowing the items to be dragged to unscramble.
Works on horizontal, vertical or grid versions of Tile (as in one column, one row or multiples)
Dispatches a "complete" event when done.
Can pass in an optional keys array that must match key properties
or an existing property of type keyType.
This allows, for instance, matching duplicate letters or colors.

See: https://zimjs.com/cat/scrambler.html

NOTE: if using Adobe Animate then use the latest ZIM version of CreateJS - see https://zimjs.com/cdn/

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// tile a rectangle with a color series, a dark border of width 3
// 4 columns and 1 row with a spacingH of 10
const tile = new Tile(new Rectangle(100,100,series(orange, green, blue, pink)), 4, 1, 10);

// add the tile to the Scrambler - by default it scrambles
const scrambler = new Scrambler(tile).center();

// when the tile is unscrambled it calls the complete function
scrambler.on("complete", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zogg("Yay!");
});

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
tile - an ZIM Tile
keys (default null) - An optional array of values that the order of the tile must match
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without keys, Scrambler will match the exact starting order
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but sometimes there are multiple answers like two letter Ts or three color blues
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To solve this issue, a keys array can be provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each tile should be given a key property to match the desired keys array
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance if keys = ["big", "small", "big", "small", "medium"]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then each tile item should be given a item.key = "big", etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "complete" event will be dispatched when the tile key properties are in the order of the keys
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also see keyProperty below for an alternative.
keyProperty (default null) - An optional tile item property to use to match the keys array (must have a keys array)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if keys = ["L", "O", "V", "E", "L", "Y"]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two "L" items so matching the starting order is not necessary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the L items could be swapped and still be a correct answer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the items are ZIM Label objects (use the Label backing property to make tiles)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then set the keyProperty to "text" and this will be used to match the keys array
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example - if keys = [blue, green, blue, red]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then set keysArray to "color" if a set of Rectangles are tiled with these colors
scramble (default true) - set to false to not scramble the tile - see also the scramble() method
time (default null) - if scramble is set, this is the time in seconds to animate the scramble - see also ZIM TIME constant
wait (default null) - if scramble is set, this is the time in seconds to wait to scramble - see also ZIM TIME constant
num (default 1) - the number of times it will scramble within the time given if a time is given otherwise always just one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is good to scramble a small number of things - for instance set to 3 to visibly scramble 4 things...
shadowColor - (default rgba(0,0,0,.3)) set to -1 for no shadow
shadowBlur - (default 5) how blurred the shadow is if the shadow is set
swap - (default false) set to true to not automatically shift tiles and swap the dragged tile with the tile that is dropped on
swapLock - (default false) set to true to lock tiles that are in the right spot - will set swap to true
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
scramble(time, wait, num) - scramble the tile - this is done by default when making the Scrambler
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the default can be set to false and scramble called manually - or to rescramble, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time and wait default to 0 and are the seconds to animate and wait to animate - also see ZIM TIME constant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;num is how many times to scramble within the time - set to 3 for instance to scramble a small number of items
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note that the tiles cannot be dragged from when called to when done scrambling
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns object for chaining
solve(time, wait, disable) - solve the tile - so arrange the tile in the start order
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time and wait default to 0 and are the seconds to animate and wait to animate - also see ZIM TIME constant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disable defaults to true and will stop the tile items from being draggable after solved
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this uses a noMouse() so mouse() can be called on each tile item at a later point if desired
test() - returns true if tiles match starting orientation or keys if keys provided
testItem(item, index) - test a specific item in the Scrambler to see if correct - index is optional otherwise it will calculate it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note - there is a "complete" event and complete property so usually there is no need to test an item
clone() - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied
dispose() - removes from parent, removes event listeners - must still set outside references to null for garbage collection

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:
on(), off(), getBounds(), setBounds(), cache(), uncache(), updateCache(), dispatchEvent(),
addChild(), removeChild(), addChildAt(), getChildAt(), contains(), removeAllChildren(), etc.

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
complete - get whether the Scrambler is complete - also see the "complete" event
starts - an array of start indexes (will be [0,1,2,3...])
order - get or set an array of the current index order (will be the scrambled order - eg. [3,2,0,1...])

ALSO: see ZIM Container for properties such as:
width, height, widthOnly, heightOnly, draggable, level, depth, group
blendMode, hue, saturation, brightness, contrast, etc.

ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container properties, such as:
x, y, rotation, scaleX, scaleY, regX, regY, skewX, skewY,
alpha, cursor, shadow, name, mouseChildren, mouseEnabled, parent, numChildren, etc.

EVENTS
dispatches a "complete" event when the tile changes to the same order as the start order
dispatches a "scrambled" event when the tile is finished scrambling

ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container events such as:
added, click, dblclick, mousedown, mouseout, mouseover, pressdown (ZIM), pressmove, pressup, removed, rollout, rollover


************************************
[70506] Scroller(backing, speed, direction, horizontal, gapFix, stage, container, style, group, inherit)

Scroller
zim class extends a createjs.EventDispatcher

DESCRIPTION
Scroller animates a backing either horizontally or vertically (not both).
The Scroller object will create a clone of the backing
and animate and swap the backgrounds when needed.

NOTE: A scroller can be added to a Accelerator object
this will allow the percentSpeed to be synched with other Scroller and Dynamo objects
See https://zimjs.com/zide/
See https://zimjs.com/explore/sidescroller.html (with keys)

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const one = new Rectangle(1200, 400, red);
F.makeCircles().center(one);
S.addChild(one);

const scroller = new Scroller(one);

S.update();

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
backing - an object to animate (make start and end edges match to be seemless)
speed - (default 1) how fast in pixels per second the animation is going
direction - (default 1) set to -1 for left or down
horizontal - (default true) set to false to animate vertically
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can adjust the speed and direction properties dynamically
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you cannot adjust the backings and horizontal dynamically
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to change your animation, dispose() of the Scroller object and make a new one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disposing just removes the ticker - you have to remove the backings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: the gapFix and ticker parameters have been removed - see zim.Ticker
gapFix - (default 0) if a thin line appears when changing speed - try setting to 1 or 2
stage - (default background.stage) if the background is not on the stage then need to pass the stage it will be on
container - (default stage) what bounds are used for wrapping the background

METHODS
pause(state, time) - state defaults to true and pauses the scroller (sets speed to 0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set state to false to unpause the scroller (sets speed to speed before pausing)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set the time (default 0) to the seconds to take while slowing the scroller to 0 speed (also see ZIM TIME constant)
dispose() - get rid of the event listeners - you need to remove the backings (see backing properties)

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
backing1 - the original backing passed in
backing2 - the cloned backing made from the original backing
speed - how fast the animation is going in pixels per frame
baseSpeed - the scroller speed when it was first made (or can override)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used to determine percentage speed for percentSpeed property
percentSpeed - get or set the percentage of the baseSpeed - eg. 100 is at the baseSpeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this allows you to animate multiple scrollers relative to one another
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See ScrollerManager class
percentComplete - get or set the percentage the scroller has moved
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the percentage is the distance/width*100 for horizontal or distance/height*100 for vertical
direction - 0 for no direction, either left (-1) or right (1) if horizontal or up (-1) or down (1) if not horizontal
paused - read only - true if paused and false if not - must be set with pause() method

EVENTS
Dispatches a "pause" event when paused is complete (sometimes a delay to slow to pause)

************************************
[70784] Dynamo(sprite, speed, label, startFrame, endFrame, update, reversible, flip, flipVertical, style, group, inherit)

Dynamo
zim class - extends a createjs EventDispatcher

DESCRIPTION
A Dynamo can run any Sprite animation at varying speeds
You pass in an optional label, or start and end frames to define the animation frames
You can animate a Dynamo using speed or percentSpeed
percentSpeed is handy for animating at speeds relative to other animations and scrollers
You can control Dynamo speeds with mouse position - or in a Parallax object
A Dynamo loops automatically - you can pause it (with optional slowing or optional frame) and unpause it (with optional quickening)
You can also get or set its frame property at which point, it will loop from there (unless paused)
A Dynamo dispatches a "change" event every time the frame changes
and a loop event every time it loops to the start and a paused event when paused

NOTE: A Dynamo requires constant S.update() to run the Sprite
A Ticker.add(function () { // speed Code}) or just new Ticker.always() will provide the update

NOTE: A Dynamo can be added to a Accelerator object (and then to a MotionController)
this will allow the percentSpeed to be synched with other Scroller and Dynamo objects
See https://zimjs.com/zide/
See https://zimjs.com/explore/sidescroller.html

NOTE: Dynamo is an alternative to a Sprite.run() where you provide a set time for animation
but you can pause a Dynamo and then use run() and then unpause the Dynamo when the run is done
If you are controlling the Dynamo in a new Ticker.add() function,
then make sure to remove() the new Ticker function when the Dynamo is paused

EXAMPLE
// *** the Sprite will not run with a Dynamo unless there is a constant S.update()
// The new Ticker will provide a constant S.update() so that is good!

// we have a sprite of a guy and it has a "walk" animation
// we can make this run faster and slower with an accelerator:
// we pass in a speed of 30 fps and this becomes the baseSpeed

const dynamo = new Dynamo({sprite:sprite, speed:30, label:"walk", reversible:false});
Ticker.add(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// the sprite will run at 0 speed when the cursor is at the left of the stage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// and get faster as the cursor moves to the right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// at the middle it will be 30 fps and at the right it will be 60 fps
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dynamo.percentSpeed = F.mouseX/W*100*2;
});

// Here we apply damping and make the sprite play backwards at the left of half stage
var dynamo = new Dynamo(sprite, 30, "walk");
Ticker.add(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// will play backwards at 30 fps at left and forwards at 30 fps at right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// it will stop at half the stage width
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// reversible false means it will not walk backwards
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// but rather it will flip and walk in the left direction when the speed is negative
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dynamo.percentSpeed = F.mouseX/W*200 - 100;
});

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
sprite - the sprite to control
speed - (default 30) the frames per second at which to animate the sprite
label - (default null) the label of the sprite to play (see Sprite)
startFrame - (default 0) the frame to start the animation (ignored if a label is provided)
endFrame - (default sprite.totalFrames) the frame to end the animation (ignored if a label is provided)
update - (default false) set to true to update the stage (only do this if you are not already updating the stage!)
reversible - (default true) will allow percentSpeed to be negative and reverse the animation.  Set to false to use absolute value.
flip - (default true if reversible is false) will flip the scaleX of the sprite if speed is negative and reversible is set to false.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the pairing of reversible false and flip true will make a Sprite turn and walk the other way if the speed is negaitive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: also see the scaleX property
flipVertical - (default false) flip the Sprite in the vertical if the speed is negative (note also see the scaleY property)

METHODS
pause(state, time, frame) - the way to pause or unpause a Dynamo affecting the sprite animating
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;state - (default true) true pauses and setting the state to false will unpause the animation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time - (default 0) time in milliseconds to slow the animation down if pausing or speed it up if unpausing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frame - (default null) which frame to pause on - overrides time (unless you want to do the calculation...)
dispose() - cancels the requestAnimationFrame

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
frames - an array of frame numbers the Dynamo is acting on according to label, or startFrame, endFrame
frame - the current frame of the Dynamo - this is sequential relative to frames
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whereas the actual Sprite frame may be different as labels can specify non-consecutive frame numbers
totalFrames - the total frames in frames (may be different than the Sprite's total frames)
percentSpeed - get or set the percentage of the baseSpeed - eg. 100 is a the baseSpeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is what you should animate to speed up and slow down the sprite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this allows you to set the speed relative to other Sprites and Scrollers
speed - get or set the speed of the sprite in frames per second
baseSpeed - the start speed given in frames per second unless changed with this property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this affects the percentSpeed so usually it is not adjusted - but it can be
paused - read only - whether the Dynamo is paused or not (by using the pause() method)
scaleX - starts with the original scaleX of the Sprite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you flip the sprite and are scaling the Sprite manually, then also set the scaleX of the dynamo to match
scaleY - starts with the original scaleY of the Sprite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you flip the sprite and are scaling the Sprite manually, then also set the scaleY of the dynamo to match

EVENTS
dispatches a "change" event when the Dynamo changes frame
dispatches a "loop" event when the Dynamo loops (possibly in reverse)
dispatches a "pause" event when the Dynamo is paused - could be delayed

[71049] Accelerator(objects)

Accelerator
zim class extends a createjs.EventDispatcher

DESCRIPTION
An Accelerator lets you set percentSpeed properties of multiple objects
such as Scroller and Dynamo (Dynamic Sprite) objects
or an object animating with animate() and the dynamic parameter set
All these have a percentSpeed property
which can be set by the Accelerator to operate the speeds.
They can also be paused and paused over time.
An Accelerator object lets you control these from one place

See: https://zimjs.com/explore/sidescroller.html

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const rect = new Rectangle()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.centerReg()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.animate({props:{rotation:360}, ease:"linear", dynamic:true});
const accel = new Accelerator(rect);
// adjust speed of the animation by mousedown
// 0% at left, 50% in middle, 100% at right, etc.
new MotionController(accel);
// or
new MotionController({target:accel, type:"mousemove", minPercentSpeed:-200, maxPercentSpeed:200});
// will change speed from -200% to 200% as cursor is moved across screen

EXAMPLE
// assuming we have scroller1, scroller2 and a sprite
// each of these would have a speed set so the scene animates nicely
const accelerator = new Accelerator([scroller1, scroller2, sprite]);

// here we increase the speed then decrease the speed of the whole scene:
animate({target:accelerator, obj:{percentSpeed:200}, time:1, rewind:true, ticker:false});

// here we change the speed of the whole scene based on the x position of the mouse
// at the very left, the speed is -200 percent and at the right the speed is 200 percent
// in the center, the speed is 0 - damping is optional but always looks better!
const damp = new Damp(accelerator.percentSpeed);
Ticker.add(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var newSpeed = (F.mouseX-W/2)/(W/2)*100*2;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accelerator.percentSpeed = damp.convert(newSpeed);
});

PARAMETERS
objects - (default null) registers Scroller or Dynamo objects the Accelerator
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass in a single object or an array of multiple objects

METHODS
add(objects) - registers Scroller or Dynamo objects with the Accelerator
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass in a single object or an array of multiple objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns the Accelerator object for chaining
remove(objects) - unregisters a Scroller or Dynamo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass in a single object or an array of multiple objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns the Accelerator object for chaining
pause(state, time, frameNumber) - pause (default) or unpause all the objects added to the Accelerator
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;state - (default true) set to false to unpause the objects added to the Accelerator
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time - (default 0) time in milliseconds to slow down to a speed of 0 and pause
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the pause event and paused property will be set after the time has passed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time is ignored if a frameNumber is provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frameNumber - (default null) get sprites to animate to the frameNumber (probably good for one sprite!)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting this will make the scene ignore the time parameter above
dispose() - calls dispose() on all the objects

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
percentSpeed - adjusts the speed relative to the baseSpeed of each items in the Accelerator - eg. 100 is at the baseSpeed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can be dynamically changed to change all speeds relatively
paused - (read only) whether the Accelerator is paused or not - only tracks if the pause() method is used
items - an array of all objects added with add()

Emitter
zim class - extends a zim.Container which extends a createjs.Container

DESCRIPTION
A particle emitter - so this makes and animates display objects like shapes or bitmaps
Particle emitters are often used for things like fireworks, fire, smoke, sparks, falling objects, etc.
The Emitter is filled with options so have a look at the doc parameters
Here are some examples:
https://zimjs.com/particles/

NOTE: consider the Emitter as somewhat experimental and pushing the bounds of the canvas
In future versions we will look into adding CreateJS StageGL (WebGL) examples / support (it might work already)
The Emitter certainly can make excellent and workable effects
But it can also bog the browser if pushed to extremes or sometimes if left going
This possibly means there are memory leaks - we have been doing our best to track things down
The Emitter is reporting an expected number of children so any leaks might be beyond ZIM control

NOTE: each particle starts at the center of the container width and height
If the trace parameter is true then the particle is put in a container that does not move
and the particle moves inside that container as the container is cached with the source-over composite operation
The currentParticle property and all the event objects' particle parameter is the moving particle
However, the children of the Emitter, will be slightly different in each case:
when trace is false, the children of the Emitter container are any active particles
when trace is true, the children of the Emitter container are the containers that hold the active particles
If you have moved, scaled or rotated the Emitter or its container,
then you will want to use var point = myEmitter.localToGlobal(particle.x, particle.y)
and get point.x and point.y to find the location of the particle relative to the stage coordinates

PARTICLES CONTAINER
By default, the Emitter will make a Container and place it beneath itself when added to the stage.
by separating the particles from the emitter, it allows the emitter to be moved without all the particles moving
the container will be given a type of "Particles"

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// make a bunch of spewing pink circles affected by gravity
const emitter = new Emitter(new Circle(5, pink))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.centerReg();

EXAMPLE
// use a sink to attract the particles
const sink = new Circle(10, pink).centerReg().alp(0);
// make one of three types of particles and randomize the colors
const particles = new Emitter({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj:[
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Circle(20,null,darker,2),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Rectangle(30,30,null,darker,2),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Triangle(40,40,40,null,darker,2)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;random:{color:[blue, green, pink, yellow, orange]},

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animation:{props:{scale:40}, time:3, ease:"linear"}
}).center();
emitter.particles.setMask(new Rectangle(400,400).center().alp(0));

EXAMPLE
// use a StageGL Frame and createjs.SpriteSheetBuilder for circles:
new Frame({ready, scale:FIT, width:1024, height:768, gpu:true});
function ready() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// if we pass in just a Circle then we would have to turn on cache
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// and cache on WebGL counts as an image for each one
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// whereas a SpriteSheet just counts as an image for all of the particles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// so build a SpriteSheet from the Circle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var builder = new createjs.SpriteSheetBuilder();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;builder.addFrame(new Circle(50, purple));
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;builder.build();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const emitter = new Emitter({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj:new Sprite({spriteSheet:builder.spriteSheet}),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;num:10, // ten Sprites made every .02 seconds for about 1000 particles per second
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life:2,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interval:.02,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gravity:0,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;force:2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}).centerReg();
}

// see more examples at https://zimjs.com/particles

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
obj - |ZIM VEE| (default blue, green, pink Circles) a display object to clone - eg. new Circle(10, green);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can also specify a shape config object with the following properties to draw inside a shape as an alternative to the trace property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{type:"shape", s:white, ss:1, f:red, sd:{noPick:[20, 10]}, offset:3}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the parameters accept ZIM VEE values except the type and sd as it requires an array as a final value
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type:"shape" is required.  s is setStroke, ss is setStrokeStyle, sd and offset are setStrokeDash in CreateJS
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;line thickness (ss) is currently not staying in the latest CDN CreateJS - this is working in the NEXT build
width - (default 300) the width of the Emitter container - used as cache bounds for trace if trace is true
height - (default 300) the height of the Emitter container - used as cache bounds for trace if trace is true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these dimensions will affect performance if the trace parameter is true so use carefully
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see the traceShiftX and traceShiftY to specify the caching rectangle position
interval - |ZIM VEE| (default .02) the time in seconds between emitting particles
num - |ZIM VEE| (default 1) the number of particles emitted each interval
life - |ZIM VEE| - (default 1) the time in seconds the particle will exist (also see ZIM TIME constant - same for all times)
fade - (default true) Boolean to fade the particle (alpha 0) - set to false to not fade out the particle over the decayTime
shrink - (default true unless trace is true) Boolean to shrink the particle (scale 0) - set to false to not shrink the particle over the decayTime
warm - (default null) set true to make particles ahead of time to look like the emitter has been running
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to true to use life/duration as from then on there would be repeat - or set to a desired number of particles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will temporarily turn off the pooling to make the warmed particles
decayTime - (default 1) time in seconds to fade and / or shrink the particle - ends animation at the life time unless decayStart is set
decayStart - (default null) time in seconds to start the decayTime otherwise decay (fade and shrink) ends at the end of life time
trace - (default false) Boolean set to true to leave trails by caching each particle with source-over composite operation
traceFadeTime - (default decayTime) time in ms to fade out traced particle to 0 alpha at the end of the particle life time
traceShiftX - (default 0) x amount to shift the cache rectangle for the traced particle
traceShiftY - (default 0) y amount to shift the cache rectangle for the traced particle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the particle starts centered in the width and height of the Emitter container
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you have particles falling - for instance fireworks, you can shift the cache rectangle down to see more trails
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then place the Emitter up higher on the stage
angle - |ZIM VEE| (default {min:0, max:360}) the angle the particle will emit (0 is along the positive x axis)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you want to shoot particles in one direction just use angle = 20
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you want something shooting up on either side of the y axis you can use:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angle = {min:-90-20, max:-90+20}; this may be easier to visualize
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you want to emit at 45 or 90 then use [45, 90]
force - |ZIM VEE| (default 5) the force for the emitter to shoot the partice at an angle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you want to shoot a variety use force = {min:2, max:10} etc.
gravity - (default 9.8) the force of gravity going down - can be negative to make particles float up
wind - (default 0) a force you can apply in the horizontal direction either negaitive for left or positive for right
layers - (default TOP) where to place the current particle being emitted - values are TOP, "bottom", "random"
animation - |ZIM VEE| (default null) a zim animate config object to apply to the particle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the whole zim DUO object to pass to animate - including a props parameter that holds the animation object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pass in two or more animations on the same particle then use {noPick:[{animation1}, {animation2}, {etc.}]}
random - (default null) an object holding properties to animate, each property holding a ZIM VEE Value object for Pick.choose() to pick from per particle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg: {color:[red, white, green], scale:{min:1, max:2}} // scale is a convienence property for both scaleX and scaleY
horizontal - (default false) start the particles across the emitter's width at the top of the emitter (unless vertical is set to true)
vertical - (default false) start the particles across the emitter's height at the left of the emitter (unless horizontal is set to true)
sink - (default null) an object with x and y properties (can be a display object) that the particles will be pulled to (or pushed if sinkForce is negative)
sinkForce - |ZIM VEE| - (default 10 if sink) the force particles are moved towards the sink location
cache - (default mobile() or false if gpu) Boolean to cache each particle - helpful if complex shape or text (do not use for Bitmap or SpriteSheet)
events - (default false) Boolean - set to true to receive events from Emitter
startPaused - (default false) Boolean - set to true to start the Emitter in the paused state
pool - (default true) Boolean if true, makes as many particles as it needs before recycling particles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this improves performance as new particles do not need to be made and old ones remove
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see also the clearPool() method to start collecting a new type of particle, etc.
poolMin - (default 0) a minimum number of pooled particles before new particles are no longer made (if pool is true)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. setting poolMin to 100 would make 100 particles and then start reusing these particles for performance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you set pool to true and do not specify a poolMin then ZIM will calculate the needed number to properly recycle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but you can override this number if you want a larger pool for more selection
particles - (default null) a container for the particles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by default, the Emitter will make a Container and place it beneath itself when added to the stage.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by separating the particles from the emitter, it allows the emitter to be moved without all the particles moving
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the container will be given a type of "Particles"
focusWarm - (default true) if Emitter window pauses on blur and comes back in focus Emitter will warm (see warm parameter)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can set to a number or false or leave as true to use life/interval as the number of particles to instantly create
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this parameter is independent of the warm parameter - so will run even if warm is null

METHODS
spurt(num, time, restart) - shoots particles (usually would pause Emitter before doing this)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supports ZIM DUO config object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;num - |ZIM VEE| (default null) number of particles to emit according to Emitter settings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time - |ZIM VEE| (default null) alternatively, time in seconds to emit particles according to Emitter settings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if both num and time are provided the faster one will stop the emitting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dispatches three different spurt events - see events
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restart (default false) set to true to restart the particles when spurted (removes old particles)
pauseEmitter(state, restart, freeze, immediate) - pause or unpause the Emitter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;state (default true) will pause the emitter or set to false to unpause the emitter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will set the read only paused property to true or false accordingly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restart (default false) set to true to restart the particles when unpaused
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise continues the particles from where they were
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;freeze (default false) set to true to freeze the particles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;othewise pause just stops emitting and existing particles continue their life
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immediate (default false) set to true to emit right away after unpausing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise just emits on normal schedule
clearPool() - clear the pool of particles - use if you change the obj or its properties (no effect if pool parameter is false)
resize(width, height) - resizes the Emitter container and any cache bounds for new particles
hasProp(property as String) - returns true if property exists on object else returns false
clone() - makes a copy with properties such as x, y, etc. also copied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all current properties will be cloned except for startPaused for which the initial parameter value is cloned
dispose() - removes event listeners from Window and content and removes any new Ticker functions

ALSO: ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO: see the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:
on(), off(), getBounds(), setBounds(), cache(), uncache(), updateCache(), dispatchEvent(),
addChild(), removeChild(), addChildAt(), getChildAt(), contains(), removeAllChildren(), etc.

PROPERTIES

emitterPaused - read only Boolean as to whether the Emitter is paused or not - see also pauseEmitter() method
particles - a reference to the Container that holds the particles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particles has noMouse() set to if interaction is desired use emitter.particles.mouse()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this container will be given a type of "Particles"
currentParticle - the latest particle emitted
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if trace is false then this is myEmitter.getChildAt(myEmitter.numChildren-1);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if trace is true then this is myEmitter.getChildAt(myEmitter.numChildren-1).getChildAt(0);

particle -  a reference to the particle for the child (could be to itself)
particleNormal - true or false if particle is not decaying or fizzing
particleDecaying - true or false if decaying - particle is currently animating to either scale 0 or alpha 0

x, y, rotation, scaleX, scaleY, regX, regY, skewX, skewY,
alpha, cursor, shadow, name, mouseChildren, mouseEnabled, parent, numChildren, etc.

EVENTS
** the below events all have a particle property that gives access to the particle (not the particle container for a traced particle - ask for the particle.parent for that)
dispatches a "spurted" event once the spurt() method is finished emitting particles
dispatches a "spurtdecayed" event once the last spurted particle decays (fade / shrink)
dispatches a "spurtfizzed" event once the last spurted particle's life ends
** the below events only trigger if the events parameter is set to true (default is false for slight performance edge)
dispatches an "emitted" event when a particle is made
dispatches a "decayed" event when the particle's decayStart + decayTime ms has elapsed
dispatches a "fizzed" event when the particle's life ms has elapsed

************************************
[72151] Generator(color, strokeColor, strokeWidth, draw, stamp, setup, maxCount, boundary, drawCount, drawPause, drawSpacebarPause, startX, startY, cache, recordLinePoints, frame, seed, output, outputType, style, group, inherit)

Generator
zim class - extends a ZIM Container which extends a CreateJS Container

DESCRIPTION
Used for dynamic drawing such as generative art or visualizations.
Generator provides a set of RELATIVE drawing commands
that primarily match the traditional absolute drawing commands for shapes on the canvas.
Rather than add all these commands to the Shape class they have been added to the Generator class.
This optimizes the Shape class which is used for all components and ZIM shapes.

HOW IT WORKS
The arrangement is similar to Processing (or P5js for a JS version).
There is one Shape that gets drawn into and code can be put in three different callback functions:

setup - happens once at the start (similar to Processing)
draw - happens at the framerate (similar to Processing)
stamp - loops all at once (different that Processing?)

SETUP
The optional setup runs once before the draw or stamp functions run.
This function will not be used as much as in Processing because ZIM has a Frame().
Also, things can be set up before the Generator code is called.
And the Generator class has parameters for color, strokeColor and strokeWidth.
Generator defaults to start at the center of the stage - so in the setup,
translate(-W/2, -H/2) could be used to start at the top left.
Setup can be run again with resetup()

DRAW
The optional draw function runs at the framerate and receives count, total and shape parameters.
This will have the affect of animating the drawing as it "processes" the code
By default, this will pause and unpause when the screen or the spacebar is pressed.
Draw can be drawn again with redraw()

STAMP
The optional stamp function runs inside a loop and produces the final drawing at once.
The function receives count, total, shape and stampNum parameters.
You can switch between the stamp and draw function with the same code inside.
The end product will be the same.
Stamps can be stamped again with restamp()

RELATIVE
The draw and stamp work the same way, running the code inside for each count.
The magic happens because the commands are relative.
Even g.rectangle().rotate(5) is beautiful.
Each new rectangle after the first will be rotated 5 degrees
In absolute space, the corner points would have to be calculated with sine and cosine - ew.
Generator does the matrix calculations to avoid this.
Each new command starts where the last command left off.
But each command also has an x and y value to translate if desired.
This x and y value is relative to the current rotation and scale.
Often, the x and y is left at 0, 0.
We considered removing them as parameters because translate() can be called
but we left them in to be the same as Processing.

COUNT, PAUSE AND STEP
The count parameter of draw or stamp suplies the current count.
This provides ways to modify commands.
for instance circle(0,0,count*10); will draw circles that get bigger.
This can also be used to set the rate of change - often by using smaller factors such as count*.01, etc.
Count can also be used to pause or do something different at certain places in the drawing
Pause also has an optional number of seconds to pause or a ZIM interval() and pause(false) can be used.
Generator has a count property which can be set to go forward or back to a certain count.
Step calls a step - usually used when pause is true - an interval could then be used for steps

PUSH AND POP
There is also push() and pop() as in Processing.
These remember the position, rotation, scale and skew when push() is used
and then return the generator to these settings when pop() is used.
Multiple pushes can be set and then popped back.
These can be used to make fractals with recursive branching.

CLEAR AND RESET
The clear() method will clear the image but keep the transforms
The reset() method will reset the transforms, set to startX and startY and reset color, strokeColor and strokeWidth
These can also be called through resetup(), redraw() and restamp()

EXPORT
Generator() can export frames as images that can then be compiled into a video.
Set the output parameter to true or a file prefix string (otherwise the prefix will be gen).
This will make Generator() use draw (even if stamp is set)
at 6 frames per second so the Browser can handle file saves.
The files will be saved with 6 numbers: gen_000000.png, gen_000001.png, etc.
They will be saved in your Browser's default downloads so MOVE them into a folder of their own.
See the note at bottom about enabling Browser Automatic Downloads.
NOTE: the canvas background color does not show up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if desired, add a new Rectangle(W, H, F.color).addTo().bot();
NOTE: Generator() will output the first image before it starts drawing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can delete the first image if you want the video to start at the first drawn frame.
NOTE: FFmpeg is suggested but there are other options such as https://github.com/spite/ccapture.js
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or screen capture software such as OBS - if just posting to Twitter and quality does not matter.
Instructions to make a video from saved image series:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Download FFmpeg: https://zimjs.org/cdn/ffmpeg.zip, UNZIP it and put it INTO the image folder.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open a command line.  On PC, type "command" into the Windows search box then on the command line type:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cd \path\to\images or to change drive use /d like cd /d E:\path\to\images
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once in the directory with your images type (or paste) something like:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ffmpeg -r 60 -f image2 -s 1024x768 -i gen_%06d.png -vcodec libx264 -crf 25 -pix_fmt yuv420p final.mp4
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can read about these at https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html (but would not bother)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-r framerate (fps)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-f canonical form (image2 to work with image sequences)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-s resolution
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-i file name to find with %06 representing 6 decimal placeholder
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-vcodec codec
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-crf quality - the lower the better... 10-30 is fine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-pix_fmt pixel format
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;final.mp4 the output video
NOTE: to enable Multiple File Downloads in Chrome "simply" go to
menu &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Site Setting &gt;
Permissions &gt; Addtional Permissions &gt; Automatic Downloads &gt; turn Ask ON
We found that ADD site: file:///path/ to local file did not seem to prevent Chrome from asking.
And part way through Chrome asked again for permission to download but the process still worked.
Alternatively, we could look at saving Blobs (data) of the images but the download process works.

GENERAL EXAMPLES
SEE: https://zimjs.com/cat/generator.html
SEE: https://zimjs.com/codepen/bloob.html // for animating stamps with noise

NOTE: The drawing uses matrix transforms on Shape which takes the shape out of traditional positioning.
A drawing property is available on the Generator that points to a Container that holds the drawing.
This container can be moved, dragged, etc. so use this to manipulate the drawing in a traditional manner.
The generator has a shape property which can be used to access the raw shape for absolute drawing for instance.

NOTE: The drawing container is automatically added to the default stage as the Generator is created

NOTE: if manually caching generator.shape or generator.drawing,
there is a slight time delay before shape is drawn so cache when the "complete" event is called

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// Draw a line from the center of the stage to 100 pixels to the right
// usually we draw inside a draw or stamp function
const g = new Generator();
g.line(0,0,100,0);

EXAMPLE
// draw an octagon - stop at 8 lines
const g = new Generator({draw:gen});
function gen(count) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.line(0,0,100,0).rotate(45);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (count == 8) g.stop();
}

// or use maxCount:
const g = new Generator({draw:gen, maxCount:8});
function gen(count) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.line(0,0,100,0).rotate(45);
}

// make a Blob with points of drawing
// could set interactive:false on Blob for just filled in picture
// lines will not fill in Generator
// shapes fill and curves fill themselves but not collectively
const g = new Generator({stamp:gen, maxCount:8, recordLinePoints:true});
function gen(count) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.line(0,0,100,0).rotate(45);
}
g.on("complete", makeBlob);
function makeBlob() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Blob({points:g.linePoints, color:red}).addTo();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.drawing.removeFrom()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
}

EXAMPLE
// draw a fan of lines always going back to 0,0
const g = new Generator({draw:gen, maxCount:360/5});
function gen(count) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.line(0,0,200,0).translate(-200).rotate(5);
}

// or stamp the fan of lines:
const g = new Generator({stamp:gen, maxCount:8});
function gen(count) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.line(0,0,100,0).rotate(45);
}

// make random color lines with a hole in the middle and draggable
const g = new Generator({stamp:gen, strokeColor:[red,pink,purple], strokeWidth:2, maxCount:360/5});
function gen(count) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.line(50,0,200,0).translate(-250).rotate(5);
}
g.drawing.drag();

// make a series of color lines with a hole in the middle and draggable
// using push() and pop() to not think about how to reset!
// so... draw a line, go back to how it was before drawing, rotate, then draw a line, etc.
// each time it draws the line it chooses the next ZIM VEE value in the series
const g = new Generator({stamp:gen, strokeColor:series(yellow,green,orange), strokeWidth:5, maxCount:360/5});
function gen(count) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.push().line(50,0,200,0).pop().rotate(5);
}

// add a circle to the end
const g = new Generator({stamp:gen, strokeColor:series(yellow,green,orange), strokeWidth:5, maxCount:360/5});
function gen(count) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.push().line(50,0,200,0).circle(15,0,5).pop().rotate(5);
}

// removing circle stroke and adding fill the same color as the stroke
// note, do not remove the stroke first or the currentColor will be null
// currentColor is the applied color from the ZIM VEE value
const g = new Generator({draw:gen, strokeColor:series(yellow,green,orange), strokeWidth:5, maxCount:360/5});
function gen(count) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.push()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.line(50,0,200,0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.fill(g.currentStrokeColor)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.noStroke()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.circle(15,0,5)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .pop()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .rotate(5);
}

EXAMPLE
// using ZIM VEE series to adjust stroke color and width
const g = new Generator({draw:gen, maxCount:360/2, strokeColor:green});
const s = series({min:1, max:4}).step(.1).bounce(); // stroke sizes
const c = series(blue,pink,green).every(12); // color change
function gen(count, total, g) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.rectangle(0,0,200,200)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.stroke(g.currentStrokeColor.toColor(c,.3), s) // blend color change
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.rotate(2);
}

EXAMPLE
// Clone example
const g1 = new Generator({draw:gen, maxCount:360/10});
function gen(count, total, g) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// note: we have three generators calling this function
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// so collect and use the generator g that is calling gen()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.rectangle(0,0,100,100).rotate(10);
}
const g2 = g1.clone();
g2.drawing.mov(100);
const g3 = g1.clone();
g3.drawing.mov(-100);

EXAMPLE
// draw rectangles that get smaller and translate like a starfish
const g = new Generator({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;draw:gen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color:series(yellow,green,orange),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strokeColor:white,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strokeWidth:3,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maxCount:100/.3
});
function gen(count, total) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var mod = count*.3
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g.rectangle(mod, mod, 100-mod, 100-mod, 0).rotate(30);
}

EXAMPLE
// common processing tree
const g = new Generator({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strokeColor:green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strokeWidth:2,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setup:gen
});
function gen() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var length = 150;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.translate(0, H/2);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;branch(150, 5);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// recursive function - not stamp or draw
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function branch(length, thickness) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.line(0,0,0,-length);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (length &gt; 4) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.push().rotate(30);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;branch(length*.75);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.pop().push().rotate(-30);

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)

color - |ZIM VEE| (default null) the fill color of shapes and individual curves (lines do not fill like in normal shape drawing)
strokeColor - |ZIM VEE| (default white) the color of the stroke or shape border
strokeWidth - |ZIM VEE| (default 1) the thickness of the stroke or shape border
draw - (default null) an optional function to call within an internal ZIM new Ticker that runs at the frame rate
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;draw will receive count, maxCount and generator parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will result in the same drawing as the stamp function but animates the drawing
stamp - (default null) an optional function to call within an internal ZIM loop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stamp will receive count, maxCount and generator parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will result in the same drawing as the draw function but happens right away (or within syncronous processing time)
setup - (default null) an optional function to call before the stamp or call functions run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setup will receive count (0), maxCount and generator parameters
maxCount - (default 1000) the maximum number of times the stamp or draw functions will run
boundary - (default null) the drawing size if cache is true
drawCount - (default 1) the count per draw.  Set to a higher number to slow down the drawing (2 is twice as long)
drawPause - (default true) set to false to not pause the draw function on stage mousedown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will dispatch "generatorpaused" and "generatorunpaused" events
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note the pause() method as well to handle pauses manually
drawSpacebarPause - (default true) set to false to not pause the draw function when the spacebar key is pressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will dispatch "generatorpaused" and "generatorunpaused" events
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note the pause() method as well to handle pauses manually
startX - (default S.width/2) set to 0 to start at stage left, etc.
startY - (default S.height/2) set to 0 to start at stage top, etc.
cache - (default false) set to true to cache image and boost performance - especially when dragging a complex drawing afterwards
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you notice performance issues then set cache to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting cache to true will be a little blurry
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: if manually caching shape, there is a slight time delay before shape is drawn so use the "complete" event to applying cache()
recordLinePoints - (default false) set to true to record the end points of line() commands
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to "nonzero" to also record non-zero start points
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to "zero" to also record 0,0 start points (and non-zero start points (and end points)))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see the linePoints property to retrieve the array as [[x,y], [x,y], [x,y], etc.]
frame - (default zimDefaultFrame) change to another frame if not drawing in the zimDefaultFrame
seed - (default null) a specific seed for the Generator Noise - otherwise random
output - (default null) set to true to export frames as images
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to a string to change the prefix of the file names to something other than "gen"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;output will export a series of images with six digits.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The images can be compiled into a video
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEE the EXPORT section at the bottom of the Generator() docs description.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also see outputType
outputType - (default "png") or set to "jpeg" - the file type used if the output parameter is set to true
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
** ALL PARAMETER BELOW SUPPORT |ZIM VEE|
** These are relative shape commands similar to traditional shape commands (see Shape on Docs)
** Note that the curves also include an x and y as the first two parameters
** Methods return the generator for chaining (unless otherwise specified)
fill(color) - sets the color or no fill if left empty or null is passed in
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see lighten(), darken(), toColor()
stroke(color, size) - sets the stroke color and / or stroke size
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leaving one empty or null will not adjust that parameter - see noStroke() to remove stroke
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see lighten(), darken(), toColor(), thicken()
noStroke() - turn the stroke off
translate(x, y) - move the location relatively
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the shape is rotated then translate(100) will move along the rotation angle
rotate(degrees) - relatively rotate future drawing by this angle - does not affect previously drawn shapes
scale(x, y) - relatively scale future drawing by this amount - does not affect previously drawn shapes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leaving y out will scale both x and y the same
skew(x, y) - relatively skew future drawing by this angle - does not affect previously drawn shapes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leaving y out will NOT skew the y
line(x1, y1, x2, y2) - draw a line from the start x and y to the end x and y
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will be oriented to the current rotation and scaled and skewed to the current scale and skew settings
arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, anticlockwise) - an arc that will be adjusted to current transform settings
curve(x1, y1, cpx, cpy, x2, y2) - a quadratic curve that will be adjusted to current transform settings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x1 and y1 - the start point - note the Shape qt() or CreateJS graphics.curveTo() do not include this start point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cpx and cpy - control point adjusted relatively to current transform settings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x2 and y2 - the final point adjusted relatively to current transform settings
bezier(x1, y1, cp1x, cp1y, cp2x, cp2y, x2, y2) - a cubic bezier curve that will be adjusted to current transform settings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x1 and y1 - the start point - note the Shape bt() or CreateJS graphics.bezierTo() do not include this start point
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cp1x and cp1y - control point for the first point's Bezier handle adjusted relatively to current transform settings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cp2x and cp2y - control point for the second point's Bezier handle adjusted relatively to current transform settings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x2 and y2 - the final point adjusted relatively to current transform settings
rectangle(x, y, w, h, a, b, c, d) - a rectangle if x, y, w, h are provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a, b, c, d are for rounding the corners
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if only a is provided then all corners will round to a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise they start at the top left and go clockwise to bottom left
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a: topLeft, b:topRight, c:bottomRight, d:bottomLeft
circle(x, y, radius, percent, percentClose) - a circle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with percent like the ZIM Circle() - to make a semicircle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and percentClose (default true) to close the path of the semicircle
oval(x, y, w, h) - an oval specified by with width and height which will be adjusted relative to current transform settings
poly(x, y, radius, sides, pointSize, angle) - a polygon like the ZIM Poly() but with x,y and angle parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;radius - (default 50) the radius (from the center to the edge or half the diameter) ;-)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sides - (default 5) the number of sides
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pointSize - (default 0) a factor that will indent or outdent the sides to form stars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 is no indent - 1 is a complete indent - which will have no fill and if there is a border will look like a stick figure
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beyond 1 is cool - it overlaps on itself and makes multiple patterns
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angle - (default 0) along the relative x axis - different than Poly() which rotates negaitve 90 to start
** ALL PARAMETERS ABOVE SUPPORT |ZIM VEE|
push() - remember the current transform properties (x,y,rotation,scale,skew) and color and stroke properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see pop() to return to these remembered property settings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note push() can be used any number of times before pop() is used, effectively nesting remembered states
pop() - return to the remembered transform properties (x,y,rotation,scale,skew) and color and stroke properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see push() to set remembered properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note push() can be used any number of times before pop() is used, effectively nesting remembered states
step() - advance the draw function one time - good for when the generator is paused to then step through calculations
blit() - write to drawing cache - if cache is true - done automatically if using draw, stamp or setup
pause(state, time) - pause or unpause the generator with optional time in seconds (see ZIM TIME constant)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will dispatch a "paused" and "unpaused" event - different than the "generatorpaused" and "generatorunpaused" for stage mousedown and spacebar key
stop() - stops the Generator at which point it cannot be started - just make a new one
noise(a,b,c,d) - ZIM Noise simplex method 1,2,3,4 depending on number of parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns a value from 0 to 1 as opposed to the simplex methods which return from -1 to 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see also the seed parameter for Generator which will seed this Noise
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see https://zimjs.com/codepen/bloob.html for a good explanation and example of using Noise with Generator
clear() - clears the shape
reset() - sets the transforms back to 0 (rotation, scale, skew) and sets the x and y to startX and startY
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also sets the color, strokeColor and strokeWidth back to original values
resetup(clear) - resets and calls the setup function again
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clear defaults to true - set to false to not clear the drawing
redraw(clear, setup) - redraw starting from count 0
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clear and setup default to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to false to not clear or not call setup
restamp(clear, setup) - restamp starting from count 0
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clear and setup default to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to false to not clear or not call setup
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calling restamp increases the stampNum property - also available as the fourth parameter in stamp
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can be used to animate stamps for instance adjusting a noise input
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://zimjs.com/codepen/bloob.html
clone() - create another generator with the same settings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clone will call the same setup, draw and stamp functions,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so use the generator parameter in these functions to draw into the specific generator drawings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. draw(count, total, g) {g.rectangle(0,0,100,100).rotate(5)}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make a copy of generator output, clone() the generator.drawing
dispose() - stops and disposes the Generator - the drawing may still need to be removed

ALSO ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
** THESE NEED to be used on the Generator drawing property
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO See the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:
on(), off(), getBounds(), setBounds(), cache(), uncache(), updateCache(), dispatchEvent(),
addChild(), removeChild(), addChildAt(), getChildAt(), contains(), removeAllChildren(), etc.

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
drawing - reference to the ZIM Container that holds the drawing shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;automatically added to the stage when new Generator() is made
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** use this for applying ZIM methods and properties to the drawing
shape - reference to the ZIM Shape object being draw into
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** because of the matrix being used, this does not respond to position methods or properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see the drawing property above to drag, animate, loc, etc.
count - the current count in the draw or stamp loop
maxCount - the number the draw or stamp loop will loop to
drawCount - how many counts go by until the draw function runs - default is 1 for each count
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting to 2 will draw twice as slow, 10 will draw ten times as slow, etc.
stampCount - how many times the stamp function has been called with restamp()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is also passed in as the fourth parameter to the stamp function
color - |ZIM VEE| get the current color - will set too but not until the next draw - use the fill() method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this could be a ZIM VEE value - also see currentColor for the color actually being applied (after ZIM VEE is picked)
currentColor - the actual color being applied (after ZIM VEE is picked)
strokeColor - |ZIM VEE| get the current strokeColor - will set too but not until the next draw - use the stroke() method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this could be a ZIM VEE value - also see currentStrokeColor for the color actually being applied (after ZIM VEE is picked)
currentStrokeColor - the actual stroke color being applied (after ZIM VEE is picked)
strokeWidth - |ZIM VEE| get the current strokeWidth - will set too but not until the next draw - use the stroke() method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this could be a ZIM VEE value - also see currentStrokeWidth for the color actually being applied (after ZIM VEE is picked)
currentStrokeWidth - the actual stroke width being applied (after ZIM VEE is picked)
currentX - get the current x value
currentY - get the current y value
linePoints - if the recordLinePoints parameter is true then this is an array of [x,y] values
paused - read only as to the pause state of the Generator - see also pause() method
stack - current array of push() remembered transforms stored as a matrix
colorStrokeStack - current array of push() remembered color, strokeColor, strokeWidth, currentColor, currentStrokeColor and currentStrokeWidth properties

ALSO See the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container properties, such as:
** THESE NEED to be used on the Generator drawing property
x, y, rotation, scaleX, scaleY, regX, regY, skewX, skewY,
alpha, cursor, shadow, name, mouseChildren, mouseEnabled, parent, numChildren, etc.

EVENTS
dispatches a "drawing" event each time the draw function is called - not used for stamp function
dispatches a "complete" event when maxCount has been reached - not dispatched if stop() is called
dispatches "paused" and "unpaused" events when pause() is used (and time of time parameter has finished)
dispatches "generatorpaused" and "generatorunpaused" events when stage mousedown or space key is pressed
and drawpause or drawSpacebarPause parameters are true

Pen
zim class - extends a ZIM Container which extends a CreateJS Container

DESCRIPTION
Handles dynamic drawing with a set of different penTypes
You can drag() or gesture() pen, move it with a MotionController(),
animate() it, animate() it along a Squiggle or Blob path, etc.

Holding down the CTRL key will allow the pen to move without drawing

SEE: https://zimjs.com/pen.html

NOTE: the pen adds either a Bitmap (if cache is true) or a Shape (if cache is false)
to the container the pen is added to.  This is layered directly under the pen.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

const pen = new Pen({penType:"kitetail", nib:new Circle(10,pink)}).center().drag();

EXAMPLE
// use a MotionController
const pen = new Pen().center();
const motionController = new MotionController({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;target:pen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type:"pressmove",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speed:60,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;damp:.5,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouseMoveOutside:true
});

// if later, animation along a path is desired
// the motionController needs to be disabled
// and the pen set to write
motionController.enabled = false;
pen.write = true;

// position the pen at the start of the path
// and set its damping to start there too...
const path = new Squiggle().loc(100,100);
pen.loc(path.pointControls[0]);
pen.immediate(pen.x, pen.y);

// if animating along a path more than once
// make sure the percentComplete is reset to 0
// (this is a tricky one!)
pen.animate({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set:{percentComplete:0},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props:{path:new Squiggle().center()},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time:1,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call:()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// to use the motionController again:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pen.write = false;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;motionController.enabled = true;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
})

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
** supports OCT - parameter defaults can be set with STYLE control (like CSS)
size - |ZIM VEE| (default depends on penType) the pen size
color - |ZIM VEE| (default depends on penType) the pen color
damp - (default .5) the damping for the pen - 0 is no movement, 1 is no damping
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;usually, set to 1 or false for following animate paths
penType - (default "line") a String of "line","kitetail","barbwire","grass","hair","city", or "splatter"
spread - |ZIM VEE| (default depends on penType) some pens use this like the splatter to determine how much the circles spread
borderColor - |ZIM VEE| (default depends on penType) a line down the middle of the pen drawing
borderWidth - |ZIM VEE| (default depends on penType) the thickness of a line down the middle of the pen drawing
end - (default "butt") the cap type as a String "butt", "square", "round" - from CreateJS
paper - (default null) a ZIM Container to hold the drawing - or Pen will make a Container to use
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see also the paper property to change containers - for layers in a drawing for instance
nib - (default null) an optional DisplayObject that will be used as the pen - would suggest centerReg({add:false}) this
cache - (default true) caches drawing in a Bitmap (improves performance) - set to false to not cache - the paper property points to the Bitmap or the Shape depending
ctrlKey - (default true) turns off drawing when CTRL key is being pressed. Set to false to not turn off drawing when the CTRL key is pressed
cropScale - (default 1) number times stage dimensions image will be cropped
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if dragging or shifting shape and paper, may want to set to 3 times the stage size for instance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: keep this at 1 for iOS to avoid oversize canvas issues.  Set to cropScale:mobile()=="ios"?1:3
undo - (default 0) number of undo levels for example 30
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;undo will be automatically recorded when each drawing stops
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;undo will also be recorded if dragging a segment(s) with SHIFT or CTRL SHIFT or deleting a segment with delete()
undoKeys - (default true - if undo is &gt; 0) use CTRL Z for undo and CTRL Y or CTRL SHIFT Z for redo - set to false to handle manually
move - (default true) set to false to not be able to drag segments or SHIFT drag all
onTop - (default true) - when dragging, does the selected line come to the top in the current paper
deleteable - (default true) - set to false to not be able to delete segments with CTRL click or all segments with CTRL SHIFT click
doubleClickDelete - (default true) - set to false to not use dblclick to delete segment
holdDelete - (default true) - set to false to not use hold (without moving) to delete segment
immediateStop - (default true) - if pressup is used (drag or MotionController) then stop drawing immediately when press is up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to false to keep drawing until damping is finished.
lineAlpha - (default 1) the alpha for each line drawn
lineBlendMode - (default "normal") the blendMode for each line drawn () - such as "difference", "multiply", etc. same as CreateJS compositeOperation
frame - (default zdf or zimDefaultFrame) the frame in which the pen will operates
dashed - (default null) set to true for a dash of 3 otherwise set to an array [size, space]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but since the pen is made up of smaller parts, the space unless small will not work and can be set to 100 or some large number.
pullColor - (default null) add a little line that pulls the pen
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when there is damping around .1 or so, the pen can seem to be behind the cursor or finger
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adding a pullLine can help the user understand this
pullThickness - (default 1) the thickness of the pull line - the pullColor must be set
style - (default true) set to false to ignore styles set with the STYLE - will receive original parameter defaults
group - (default null) set to String (or comma delimited String) so STYLE can set default styles to the group(s) (like a CSS class)
inherit - (default null) used internally but can receive an {} of styles directly

METHODS
setPen(newPen) - sets the pen and resets the default properties for the pen
immediate(x, y) - set the pen to this location without damping
clear() - clears the drawing
stop() - stops drawing and saves segment - may start drawing right away again if pen is moving...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see infinite property to make sure drawing continues as one segment until stop() is called
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;infinite is automatically set to true when animating pen along a path
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and stop() is called when animating along a path is complete (or paused)
saveState(obj, startLayer, endLayer) - record an undo state for the paper or a line segment if it is transformed - for an undo()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use after manually resizing, positioning, rotating, setting alpha and skewing the paper or a line segment
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saveState() is not needed for dragging a line segment with SHIFT, CTRL SHIFT or if dragState or dragAllState is true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;startLayer and endLayer are for if the layer level of the shape changes
undo() - go back one undo state (called automatically by CTRL Z if undoKeys is true - default)
redo() - go forward one undo state (called automatically by CTRL Y or CTRL SHIFT Z if undoKeys is true - default)
delete(index) - delete a line segment at a given index (actually sets its alpha to 0 to maintain layers on undo)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use: pen.paper.on("mousedown", function (e) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pen.delete(paper.getChildIndex(e.target)); // for instance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;})
deleteSegment(object) - delete a line segment object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use: pen.paper.on("mousedown", function (e) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pen.deleteSegment(e.target); // for instance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;})
clone() - clone the pen (note there is no exact clone)
dispose(all) - all defaults to true to dispose all listeners, the pen and the current paper
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to false to remove all listeners and the pen but not the current paper (the container and its shape)


ALSO ZIM 4TH adds all the methods listed under Container (see above), such as:
drag(), hitTestRect(), animate(), sca(), reg(), mov(), center(), centerReg(),
addTo(), removeFrom(), loop(), outline(), place(), pos(), alp(), rot(), setMask(), etc.
ALSO See the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container methods, such as:
on(), off(), getBounds(), setBounds(), cache(), uncache(), updateCache(), dispatchEvent(),
addChild(), removeChild(), addChildAt(), getChildAt(), contains(), removeAllChildren(), etc.

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
drawX - a reference to the approximate current drawing x position
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;needed because pen.x will give the location of the pen but not the drawing location because of damping
drawY - a reference to the approximate current drawing y position
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;needed because pen.y will give the location of the pen but not the drawing location because of damping
paper - the Container that holds the drawing which are Bitmap objects if cache is true or Shape objects if cache is false
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the paper is centered on the stage and may be bigger or smaller depending on the cropScale setting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the paper can be changed to a different Container or swapped back and forth for layer type control
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paper has shape, bitmap and paperNum properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clear() and dispose() will clear the current paper - not other papers - keep a reference to those and use dispose() on them if needed
lastSegment - gets the last segment drawn when pen has stopped - for instance use in a stop event function to get the line last drawn
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will be a Bitmap (if cache is true) or a Shape (if cache is false)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all segments have a paper property referring to its paper (which is also the segment's parent property)
lastSelected - gets the last selected segment - perhaps a segment was dragged, etc.
nib - get a reference to the specified nib - often not used
end - get or set the type of end for the pen - "butt", "round", "square"
write - get or set whether the pen is writing to the paper
drawing - read only Boolean as to if the pen is drawing as in moving
size - |ZIM VEE| get or set the size of the pen
sizeFactor - (default 1) get or set a factor to multiply the size of the pen (after being picked from ZIM VEE)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;works independent of sizeScale
sizeScale - (default 1) get or set scaling on the size of the pen (after being picked from ZIM VEE)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;works independent of sizeFactor
spread - |ZIM VEE| get or set the spread of the pen
spreadFactor - (default 1) get or set a factor to multiply the spread of the pen (after being picked from ZIM VEE)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;works independent of spreadScale
spreadScale - (default 1) get or set scaling on the spread of the pen (after being picked from ZIM VEE)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;works independent of spreadFactor
color - |ZIM VEE| get or set the color of the pen
pullColor - get or set the pullColor of the pen - see pullColor parameter

borderColor - |ZIM VEE| get or set the borderColor of the pen
borderWidth - |ZIM VEE| get or set the borderWidth of the pen
dampX - the ZIM Damp object for x position - change by using dampX.damp = value
dampY - the ZIM Damp object for y position - change by using dampY.damp = value
penType - get or set the type of pen - this will NOT set default properties like setPen()
undoLevels - get or set the number of undo levels
undoKeys - get or set if CTRL Z and CTRL Y / CTRL SHIFT Z are used for undo and redo
immediateStop - get or set how drawing segments ends - "both", "pressup", "mousemove" and "either" are options (see parameter for more info)
infinite - boolean to keep recording until stop() is called

ALSO See the CreateJS Easel Docs for Container properties, such as:
x, y, rotation, scaleX, scaleY, regX, regY, skewX, skewY,
alpha, cursor, shadow, name, mouseChildren, mouseEnabled, parent, numChildren, etc.

EVENTS
dispatches a "drawing" event when drawing - note lastSegment is assigned when the drawing is stopped
dispatches a "start" event when pen motion starts (mousedown)
dispatches a "stop" event when pen motion stops
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the immediateStop parameter is BOTH (default) then the pen must also be UP to trigger the stop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is if drag() or motionController({type:"pressmove"}) is being used.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the immediateStop parameter is "mousemove" then the stop will trigger when the motion stops - regardless of the pen being up or down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This setting may cause small drawing segments at corners of lines or if the pen is held down and moved slowly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the immediateStop is either then either the pressup or mousemove stopping - which ever comes first - will end segment
dispatches a "change" event for when the drawing has a new segment (or on undo / redo)
dispatches a "paperChange" event when undo or redo changes paper objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pen switches papers just before the paperChange is dispatched but before the change event is dispatched
dispatches a "paperMove" event when the paper moves with CTRL drag
dispatches a "recordUndo" when any type of undo is recorded - new segment, delete, drag, clear
dispatches an "undo" and a "redo" whenever undo and redo happens


************************************
[74540] SoundWave(num, input, include, smoothing, min, max, operation, baseline, magnify, reduce, adjust, channel)

SoundWave
zim class - extends a CreateJS EventDispatcher

DESCRIPTION
Receives a sound input and calculates frequency data using HTML AudioContext createAnalyser()
The input can be the mic, a Synth tone(), play() or the result of a asset("someSound").play() or an &lt;audio&gt; tag
You can specify the number of data points and then use the calculate() method to animate to sound

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// the app may need to be interacted with before calling this
// in a Button mousedown event or Pane close event for instance.
const soundWave = new SoundWave(50, "mic");
soundWave.on("ready", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ticker.add(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let data = soundWave.calculate();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// data is an array with 50 frequency amplitudes from low to high based on Microphone input
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;})
});

// or pass in a sound instance:

// before loading the sound with F.loadAssets() use the following:
// this forces CreateJS to use an &lt;audio&gt; tag format
// we are trying to get things to work with WebAudio and will remove this message when we do!
createjs.Sound.registerPlugins([createjs.HTMLAudioPlugin]);

// later when we the loading is complete and after interacting with app
const soundWave = new SoundWave(50, new Aud("mySound.mp3").play());

// or pass in an &lt;audio&gt; tag reference:
const soundWave = new SoundWave(50, zid("tagID"));
zid("tagID").play();

// see more examples at
// https://zimjs.com/soundwave/bars.html
// https://zimjs.com/soundwave/circles.html
// https://zimjs.com/soundwave/mouth.html

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
num - (default 120) Number of data points returned by the calculate() method
input - (default "mic") the input for the sound:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. the mic
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. the result of a ZIM Synth play() or tone()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. the results of a new Aud("someSound").play() or asset("someSound").play()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. an &lt;audio&gt; tag reference zid("tagID") make sure to zid("tagID").play()
include - (default 120/1024 = .117) a decimal range to include (0-1) - the full range (1) includes 90% very high frequencies
smoothing - (default .85) a decimal range for smoothing with 0 being choppy and .9 being slow to respond, etc.
min - (default -80 mic -100 song) minimum decibel number to pick up
max - (default -40 mic -10 song) maximum decibel number to pick up
operation - (default function below) a function that is applied to each result in the original bufferLength (1024)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the natural results are very bass heavy with roughly a straight line heading down as frequency gets higher
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the default function reduces the bass by half and slowly rises towards the original values for higher frequency
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function(amplitude, i) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return amplitude * (.5+i*1/Math.pow(SoundWave.bufferLength, .95));
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can pass in a different function to take the place of the default function
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the function receives the original amplitude and index as parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can use SoundWave.bufferLength to get the total number of values in the original data (1024)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: the data returned by the calculate() method will be only the included range - eg. .117 of the total original values (starting at low frequency)
baseline - (default 0 for mic and 30 for sound) removes this amount of amplitude from each data point (after operation is applied)
magnify - (default 1 for mic and 10 for sound) multiplies the data point by this much (after the baseline is removed)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by removing the baseline amount and multiplying what's left the difference in wave data is increased
reduce - (default 0) subtracts this amount from each data point (after magnified)
adjust - (default 10) seconds to adjusts the max value used for calculate(normalized)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a maximum is found over this amount of time and used to normalize the rest of the frequencies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setting this to 1 second would basically keep maximum output - but loses drop offs in sound
channel - (default null) null will be both channels - set to 0 for left or 1 for right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if 0 or 1 is set then will output only that channel as sound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for both channels independently, use two SoundWave() objects one with channel:0 and one with channel:1

METHODS
calculate(normalize) - returns an array of amplitudes at various frequencies from low to high
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the array will have a length that matches the num parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the range of frequencies used will be 1024 multiplied by the include factor - eg. .117 = 120
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this 120 will be divided by the num parameter and average results over the range will be used
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this means the num parameter must be less than the 1024 times the range otherwise there is a warning
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;normalize (default true) gets frequency numbers between 0-1 - set to false to get general numbers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is controlled by the SoundWave adjust parameter which gets a maximum over time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the frequencies are divided by the maximum
setInput() - change the input to another sound
dispose(context) - disposes the analyser.  Disposes the audioContext too if context is true (default false)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the new Ticker function used in the app will need to be removed - see new Ticker.remove()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and any animated DisplayObject will need to be removed, etc.

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
num - read only num of frequency data
input - get the current input of the SoundWave - see setInput() to set the input
smoothing - a decimal range for smoothing with 0 being choppy and .9 being slow to respond, etc.
analyser - the HTML analyser object https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AnalyserNode
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with minDecibels, maxDecibels, smoothingTimeConstant and some others - see link
baseline - removes this amount of amplitude from each data point (after operation is applied)
magnify - multiplies the data point by this much (after the baseline is removed)
reduce - subtracts this amount from each data point (after magnified)
adjust - change the seconds that SoundWave adjusts for normalization

EVENTS
dispatches a "ready" event when the sound source is connected and the calculate() method is ready


************************************
[74849] Synth(volume, frequency)

Synth
zim class - extends a CreateJS EventDispatcher

DESCRIPTION
Synth has two main methods play() and tone().

PLAY
Synth will play generated sounds based on seventeen inputs.
The code library used is ZzFX from Frank Force at https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX
Thanks Frank, amazing library - nice and small too!
Sounds can be created with the interface here: https://zzfx.3d2k.com
Then just paste the resulting code into a ZIM Synth play() method.

TONE
http://zimjs.com/cat/synth.html
Tone will play a tone at a given note forever or a duration of time.
The tone() method returns a Tone object and additional notes can be added.
The tone has effects: wah, tremelo (pitch / frequency) and vibrato (gain / volume)
All the settings of the tone - volume, frequency and the effects properties
can be animated with ZIM animate() and wiggle() - controlled with MotionController
and any general interactivity on components like dials, sliders, steppers, selectors, etc.

This uses the native JS Web Audio API to make oscillators with frequency and gain.
The API is fairly complicated and cumbersome so this makes it easier.
tone() plays a note "A", "Bb", "C#", "A4", etc.
The low notes are "C0" then each number increase goes up an octavet to "G8".
New constants are provided: SINE, SQUARE, TRIANGLE, SAW, ZAP for wave shapes.
tone() also plays WaveTables - of 50 different sounds available on the ZIM CDN
See https://zimjs.com/cat/synthpad.html

NOTE: as of ZIM 015 play() and tone() each have a pan parameter
See https://zimjs.com/015/pan.html

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// play() example -
// ****** note, the app must be interacted with before sound can play
const synth = new Synth();
new Button({label:"START"}).center().tap(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;synth.play(...[,0,-1500,.3,.3,1.15,,1.01,2.37,-7.65,1100,.05,2,,-0.1,.07,5e-4]); // magical arrival
});
// This code came from here: https://zzfx.3d2k.com
// Note - it will have zzfx() and you want synth.play() - so copy what is in the brackets.
// zzfx(...[,0,-1500,.3,.3,1.15,,1.01,2.37,-7.65,1100,.05,2,,-0.1,.07,5e-4]);

// Note - above is ES6 - otherwise in ES5:
synth.play(null,0,-1500,.3,.3,1.15,null,1.01,2.37,-7.65,1100,.05,2,null,-0.1,.07,5e-4); // magical arrival

PARAMETERS (Synth)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;volume (default .3) - the default volume of sounds - will be overwritten by first parameter of play() or tone()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frequency (default 220) - the default frequency (Hz) of sounds - will be overwritten by first parameter of play() or tone()

METHODS (Synth)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;play(see parameters below) - plays a sound - see https://zzfx.3d2k.com to create data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returns a SynthSound object that dispatches a complete event when the sound is done
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SynthSound has the following properties and methods:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;audioContext - the JS AudioContext
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gain - the JS WebAudio GainNode
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duration - the duration of the sound in seconds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loop(num, offset) - see repeat below - same method.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat(num, offset) - repeat the sound forever or pass in a num - returns object for chaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offset is a value to add to the duration so 2 would wait 2 seconds before repeating
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this accepts ZIM VEE so {min:-1, max:1} might overlap or delay slightly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or series(1,2,3,4) would increase delay in repeating - see ZIM Pick()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stop() - stop the sound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;play() - play the sound again - will need to call repeat() if desired
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there is no way to pause, pan or change volume once the sound is playing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;although if one really needed to change the volume, synthSound.gain.gain.value would do it - sigh (JS WebAudio...)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tone(see parameters below) - play a tone or tones continuously or for a duration
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns a Synth Tone object - see methods and properties underneath parameters

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PARAMETERS (tone)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** supports VEE - all parameters support ZIM VEE - a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;volume (default 1) - volume is all over the map with tones and effects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Volume 1 is actually volume .1 as overall gain is dropped to 1/10 default JS Web Audio gain=1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overally gain is run through a JS compressor - see compressor property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and filters can be appied - see insertComponent() but - good luck!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note (default "A" - Synth default frequency 220) - letter notes (string) or frequency notes (number)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"C0" is the lowest note with each octave the next number up to "G8" being a very high note (ew)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle notes do not need a number and are octave 3 so a "C" is the same as "C3".
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharps are with a "#" so "C#" or "C2#" or "C#2" or "#C" or "#C####" etc. order does not matter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flats are with a "b" (the lowercase letter b) so "Bb" or "Ab2", etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shape (default SINE) - the wave form or type as a constant below - or a WaveTable JSON or custom shape
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constants: (each is the same as a lowercase string - eg. SINE is "sine")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SINE - a sine wave for a smooth sound - not good with Wah effect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SQUARE - an up and down wave -1/1 with a growly sound - good for wah!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TRIANGLE - a triangle shaped wave between a SINE an SQAURE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAW (SAWTOOTH) - an increase and then sudden drop - a little jagged sounding
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZAP (reverse SAW) - a loud noise followed by a slow drop to 0 repeating - pew pew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WaveTable shapes - 50 custom sounds see https://zimjs.com/cat/waves.html
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if loading JSON from file pass in asset("wavename.json") to the shape param (not just the file name)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CUSTOM - an object {real, imag} with real and imag properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the real and imag properties should be Float32Array objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but ZIM will convert arrays such as the arrays found in the WaveTables
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZIM will run a createPeriodicWave() on the object and callsetPeriodicWave()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PeriodicWave
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pan (default 0) - the pan from -1 (left) to 1 (right) with 0 in the middle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;duration (default 0) - forever - the seconds the sound will play (see also startTime) - and stop() method - also see ZIM TIME constant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attack (default .02) - seconds to ramp up sound - sound that starts or stops right away pops (crackles)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;release (default .05) - seconds to ramp down sound at end
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WAH - makes a wah sound!  Like a Wah Pedal... applies an LFO (low frequency oscillator)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wah is made with a bandpass filter - that reduces sounds at high and low frequencies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JS bandpass filter used is available as the filter property of the tone object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing the middle frequency of the bandpass will move the range up and down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We call the middle frequency the wahNote and it is the most fun to change!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range between the high and low frequency we call wahThroat (it is a Q value - quality)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The range does not exactly cut off but rather compresses the sound - so a smaller throat sounds squeezed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This also reduces the volume and can make the tone sound almost wet or like a resonance
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: other effects are done with JS Web Audio Oscillator Wah uses a ZIM Synth Oscillator
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well as the parameters, setting any wah property (tone see properties) will turn on the wah and there is a stopWah() method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wahAmount (default 1000) - how much (amplitude) the wah moves up and down across notes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wahRate (default 1) - the oscillations per second the wah moves up and down across notes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wahShape (default SINE) - the wave form (type) the oscillations take - SINE smooth, SQUARE bee boo bee boo + SAW, TRIANGLE, ZAP
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wahThroat (default 5) - the low to high range of the wah (Q) usually from .1 to 20 - will compress sound and reduce volume
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wahNote (default note) - the center note (frequency) of the wah - changing / animating this will make the most wah effect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the farther away the wahNote is from the note the more wah
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but if the wah moves too much it can cut off the sound - try within -200 and 3000 ;-)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIBRATO - oscillates frequency (pitch)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When vibrato is used, a JS Oscillator (vibrato property) is used
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to adjust a JS Gain (vibratoGain property) connected to the main note frequency to make a warble
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well as the parameters, setting any vibrato property (tone see properties) will turn on the vibrato and there is a stopVibrato() method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vibratoAmount (default 10) - the frequency range to warble
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vibratoRate (default 1) - the oscillations per second to change the frequency
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vibratoShape (default SINE) - the the wave form (type) the oscillations take - SINE smooth, SQUARE bap bap + SAW, TRIANGLE, ZAP
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TREMELO - oscillates gain (volume)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When tremelo is used, a JS Oscillator (tremelo property) is used
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to adjust a JS Gain (tremeloGain property) to make a warble
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well as the parameters, setting any tremelo property (tone see properties) will turn on the tremelo and there is a stopTremelo() method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tremeloAmount (default the tone volume * hush) - matching volumes makes a balanced wobble
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adding volumes gets really loud so reduce volume when applying tremelo
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tremeloRate (default 1) - the oscillations per second to change the gain
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tremeloShape (default SINE) - the the wave form (type) the oscillations take - SINE smooth, SQUARE doop doop + SAW, TRIANGLE, ZAP
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;startTime (default 0) - in seconds - times the note start time very accurately - also see ZIM TIME constant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generally, sequencers should use startTime and run all the notes at the start
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then the start times will play the note
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this avoids inconsistencies in interval() and animate()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But... it depends on the application
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pauseOnBlur (default false) - set to true to pause sound when window is reduced or another tab gains focus

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;METHODS (Tone)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ramp(volume, time) - set a volume with optional fade time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is a volume property but ramp() tends to avoid crackle and pop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so would recommend using volume only for animating
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stop(releaseTime) - stop the tone and fade an optional releaseTime in seconds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: to stop a tone at a given time use the duration parameter (or a stop in a timeout)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pause(state) - not really a pause but turns volume down and up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;state defaults to true for pause - set to false to unpause
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;addNote(volume, note, shape, toWah, toVibrato, startTime) add a new note to the tone - returns a Note() object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** also see notes property of tone() for array of notes - and removeNote() below
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;volume (default 1) - the volume of the note - 1 will be fine even if main volume is .1 for instance...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note (default "A") - the letter note (or frequency) of the note
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shape (default SINE) - the type of wave - see tone() wave parameter for more details
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;toWah (default true) - set to false to not add the note to the wah effect (if wah is on)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;toVibrato (default false) - set to true to add note to vibrato effect (if vibrato is turned on)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adds note automatically to tremelo - to not add note to tremelo, make a new tone()

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;removeVibrato() - removes the vibrato effect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;removeTremelo() - removes the tremelo effect
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animate() - allows for tone to be animated like animate on a DisplayObject
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animate has added note convenience property - to convert to frequency from letter notes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could animate with animate() function - but adding method makes it easier (and it is just a few lines)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wiggle() - allows tone to be wiggled like a DisplayObject
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could wiggle with wiggle() function - but adding method makes it easier (and it is just a few lines)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oscillator(frequency, gain, shape, offset) - returns a ZIM Synth Oscillator object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this gives an amplitude (plus offset) in time following the form (wave type) at the frequency
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used internally by wah effects as an offset was needed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could not figure how to get JS Oscillator to offset frequency - or gain attache to oscillator
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61666671/how-do-you-offset-gain-attached-to-an-oscillator-using-javascript-web-audio

[76290] VR(content, angle, distance, parallax, parallaxAngle, damp, parallaxDamp, startAngle, negativeParallax, borderMarkers, swiper, holder)

VR
zim class - extends a ZIM Container which extends a CreateJS Container

DESCRIPTION
Copies the content and displays a left and right channel (side-by-side) to be viewed with a VR helmet.
Content can be made to shift side to side as the head turns.  Parallax is also an option.
Works with Google Cardboard &amp; Daydream, Samsung Gear VR, Carl Zeiss VR, Merge VR, View-Master VR
And costing around $20-$30 these are fine: Utopia 360, VRIT VR, ETVR, etc.
Provides a ZIM Swiper for testing on desktop to emulate turning the head.

DETAILS
Make a content Container (with registration point at 0,0) that holds all the content.
Set a depth property on any children in the content container that you want to look 3D
or use the chainable dep() method to apply the depth property.
ZIM VR will copy the content and its depths into left and right containers and mask it.
The content can be accessed via contentLeft and contentRight properties.
The x values of the content that has depth properties set will be shifted according to the depth.
This gives a sense of 3D coming out of the screen for positive depths and into the screen for negative depths.

Device orientation can also be used to move the content as the head is turned and the headset and device moves.
Currently the horizontal movement is built in as that is the trickiest with the 3D effect.
Supply a motion angle (angle) and a motion distance (distance) about which the user will turn their head to see the content.
Optional arrows are provided to map the boundaries of rotation and available as borderLeft and borderRight properties.
You can manually apply vertical shift based on the ZIM Frame deviceOrientation event about the x axis

Horizontal Parallax is provided if desired and will be based on the head rotation if no motion angle is provided
or based on the distance of the object from the center of view if a motion angle is provided.
You can set the parallax details as well like the magnitude, angle, damping, and negative parallax.
Negative values of depth will not produce parallax unless negativeParallax is set to true (this looks funny).
You can make your own vertical parallax if desired using ZIM Parallax and the deviceOrientation event about the x axis.

NOTE: moving content in the x direction should not be done manually.
Rather, use the position() method of VR to properly place both channels and reset the vrStartX positions required.

NOTE: To add or remove content please use the register() and remove() methods.
Any new content should be added to the initial content container.
Do this first, then set the desired depths, then register the new content.
This will clone the new content to the right side channel
and set the shift in x based on depths for both channels.

NOTE: Any modifications afterwards to other properties like alpha, color, y, registration, etc.
must be made manually to both channels - use the contentLeft and contentRight properties.
The contentLeft is the original content (also available as the content property).
You can use the vrMatch property of any content objects to get its other channel partner.
So if you have a label variable for the Label in the original content,
you can access the label in the right hand channel with label.vrMatch
The right channel objects also have vrMatch properties so label.vrMatch.vrMatch is the label ;-)

SEE: https://zimjs.com/vr/

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// Prepare content inside one container
const content = new Container(W/2, H);

// This background tile has no depth or is at "screen" depth
// There will be no depth shift and no parallax
new Tile(new Rectangle(10,10,light), 20, 1, 10).center(content);

// These rectangles are given depth using the dep() method - or set the depth property
// The rectangles will be shifted in the x by VR
// centerReg the objects for proper parallax
const box = new Rectangle(50,50,green).centerReg(content).dep(10);
new Rectangle(70,70,clear,blue,5).centerReg(content).dep(12);

// 1. this just shows content in 3D with no motion:
// const vr = new VR(content).addTo(stage);

// 2. this will move when the head is turned (device is rotated) but with no parallax:
// const vr = new VR(content, 160, 400).center();

// 3. this shows parallax when the head is turned but with no positional movement:
// const vr = new VR(content, 0, 400, 2, 60).center();

// 4. this shows motion and parallax as the head is turned:
const vr = new VR(content, 160, 400, 2, 60).center();


// this will change the color of the box after it has been added to VR:
// box.color = pink; // the left side
// box.vrMatch.color = pink; // the right side

// this would fade in and out the outer rectangles:
// var obj = {obj:{alpha:0}, loop:true, rewind:true};
// vr.contentLeft.getChildAt(2).animate(obj);
// vr.contentRight.getChildAt(2).animate(obj);

// this would remove the outer rectangle:
// vr.remove(vr.content.getChildAt(2));

// this would remove the right hand border marker
// which shows when angle is != 0 and borderMarkers is set to true (default)
// vr.remove(vr.borderRight);

// this shows an inter-ocular adjuster when the stage is pressed
S.on("stagemousedown", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vr.showAdjuster();
});

// the above works fine, but really should remove the event when stage is pressed
// because all presses using the adjuster would be calling showAdjuster
// then add the event again when the adjuster is closed
// but ZIM makes sure that adjuster does not re-open if it is already open.
// Here is what that code would look like:

// var adjusterEvent = S.on("stagemousedown", ()=&gt;{
// &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vr.showAdjuster();
// }, null, true); // run once
// vr.on("close", function() {
// &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adjusterEvent = S.on("stagemousedown", adjusterEvent);
// });

// this code turns the stage yellow if device is rotated beyond the angle parameter value
var adjusterEvent = vr.on("boundaryout", e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(e.boundary); // would be LEFT or RIGHT
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.color = yellow;
});

// this code changes the stage color back to the original when rotated back in bounds of the angle parameter
vr.on("boundaryin", e=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(e.boundary); // would be LEFT or RIGHT
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.color = lighter;
});

// this would load stereoscopic images to the left and right content (no need to registser)
// F.loadAssets(["stairsRight.jpg", "stairsLeft.jpg"]);
// F.on("complete", ()=&gt;{
// &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Pic("stairsLeft.jpg").center(vr.contentLeft);
// &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Pic("stairsRight.jpg").center(vr.contentRight);
// });

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
content - a ZIM Container with registration point at the top left that holds the content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content will be placed in the left VR Channel (Container) and cloned to the right VR Channel (Container)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the depth property (or use dep()) of any children (recursive) of the content to be viewed in 3D
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher the depth, the more it comes out of the screen which is at 0 depth
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A negative depth will go into the screen but will not have parallax (see negative parallax)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The left and right content are available as contentLeft and contentRight properties of VR
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each child of content has a vrMatch property that refers to itself in the other channel
angle - (default 0) the angle in degrees the head can turn to see VR move (half to left, half to right)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there is a small glitch in the transition at 360 degrees as damping rewinds and reverses position
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is no affordance for wrapping - so content at this location is not recommended
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fix for this might be provided some time in the future
distance - (default 100) the pixels the content will move over the angle (half to left, half to right)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR if there is no angle and there is parallax, the distance the parallax will move over the parallaxAngle
parallax - (default 0) the percentage of the depth it will move for each degree of motion up to the parallaxAngle
parallaxAngle - (default 60) the degree range that parallax will operate (half on one side and half on the other)
damp - (default .5) the damping for motion if angle is provide - quicker than normal for more response turning
parallaxDamp - (default .1) the damping for parallax - smaller number goes slower towards desired position
startAngle - (default 0) the angle to start the viewing
negativeParallax - (default false) set to true to make parallax work for negative depth (looks funny)
boundaryMarkers - (default true) set to false to remove arrow markers at angle boundaries if angle is set
swiper - (default false) set to true to use swiping if not on mobile device - for testing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If on mobile, swiper is set to false so it does not conflict with the rotation of the device
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swiper works from -330 to +330 and then stops
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there is no wrapping system so the limits prevent a glitchy transition
holder - (default zimCurrentFrame stage) set to a Container with bounds set if desired - usually, the stage (default)

METHODS
register(item) - content is usually passed in initially to the content parameter of VR
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an item (a display object) can be added at any time - to remove items, see remove().
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the desired depth property for the item with 0 being the default for the screen depth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add the item to content (contentLeft) with addTo(), center(), centerReg() before registering.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not add the item to contentRight as register() will clone the new item and its children recursively
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the right side VR Channel and set its depth and parallax.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: to add stereoscopic images, one to the left chanel and one to the right channel,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just add the images using addTo(), center() or centerReg() to contentLeft and contentRight - no need to register()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns the item
remove(item) - removes item (and children) from the content of VR - do not manually remove from left and right channels
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns the item
position(item, x, y) - positions item in VR in both left and right channels - do no manually position left and right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns the item
showAdjuster() - shows a panel to set interocular distance - this is saved across app loads
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The panel container can be accessed with adjuster property of VR
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjuster property has backing, label, strip, slider, close, zero and ok properties for formatting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The adjuster sets the regX property of the content to shift the two channels to the desired distance appart
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, this should be the distance between the eyes, but experimentation shows that a smaller distance works well
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is provided primarily for tablet or desktop where the distance may be too big for the cross-eyed viewing technique
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns the VR object
hideAdjuster() - hides the adjuster - but the close and ok buttons will do this as well - also see VR events...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns the VR object
resize() - call the resize() method to resize VR if the holder size changes - VR can be added to the ResizeManager
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns the VR object

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
angle - read only - the angle provided to the VR parameters
currentAngle - read only - the angle at which the device has been rotated since the start of the app
content - the original content provided to the VR parameters
contentLeft - the content - this shows in the left VR Channel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following read-only property is provided on all children of the content:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vrMatch - a reference to the matching child in the other VR Channel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following read-only properties are provided to children of the content that have a depth property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are given for content passed in to the content parameter and also to items passed in to the register() mehtod:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vrChannel - LEFT or RIGHT
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vrStartX - the starting x position before depth effect or parallax is added (could be changed if manually setting x position)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vrParallaxDistance - the shift in x due to parallax
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vrParallaxDamp - the ZIM Damp object to handle parallax if VR angle is != 0
contentRight - the cloned content - this shows in the right VR Channel (also see contentLeft info)
left - the container that holds the left VR Channel
right - the container that holds the right VR Channel
adjuster - the adjuster panel - see showAdjuster() method for details
swiper - the ZIM Swiper if swiper parameter is set to true to test the motion if not on device
boundaryLeft - the left boundary container if boundary parameter is true
boundaryRight - the right boundary container if boundary parameter is true

EVENTS
boundaryout - dispatched when rotated past a boundary region - the event object provides a boundary property with LEFT or RIGHT values
boundaryin - dispatched when rotated into the boundary region - the event object provides a boundary property with LEFT or RIGHT values
saved - dispatch when OK button on adjuster panel is pressed to set the interocular distance
closed - dispatches when X and OK button is pressed to close the adjuster panel

[00726] shuffle(array)

shuffle
zim function

DESCRIPTION
Randomly shuffles elements of an array.
Actually changes the original array (and also returns it).

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const array = ["happy", "sad", "spooked"];
const randomFromArray = shuffle(array)[0];
// this will be randomized each time it is run

************************************
[00780] pluck(array, remove)

pluck
zim function

DESCRIPTION
Returns a random element from an array.
Same as array[Math.floor(Math.random()*array.length)].
Or if remove is true (default is false) then returns and removes random element from array.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const colors = [orange, green, red];
zog(pluck(colors)); // orange, green or red
const answer = pluck(colors, true); // if this were red, red would be removed from array

PARAMETERS
array - an array of objects - or pass in any number of parameters to pick from

[00815] rand(a, b, integer, negative)

rand
zim function

DESCRIPTION
Returns a random integer between and including a and b if integer is true.
Returns a random number (with decimals) including a and up to b but not b if integer is false.
b is optional and if left out will default to 0 (includes 0).
integer is a boolean and defaults to true.
If a and b are 0 then just returns Math.random().

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const speed = rand(10,20); // 10, 11, 12... 18, 19 or 20

const colors = [blue, yellow, green];
const color = colors[rand(colors.length-1)]; // note the length-1

// the equivalent of:
const color = colors[Math.floor(Math.random()*colors.length)];

// OR a technique often used without using rand():
const color = shuffle(colors)[0];

// here we get a speed that is either from 5 to 10 or -5 to -10
const speed = rand(5,10,null,true);

PARAMETERS
a - the first Number for the range
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a and b are not provided, rand() acts like Math.random()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if parameter b is not provided, rand will use range 0 to and including a
b - (default 0) second Number for the range
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it does not matter if a&gt;b or a&lt;b
integer - (default true) set to false to include decimals in results
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if false, range will include decimals up to but not including the highest number

************************************
[00877] seedRandom(seed)

seedRandom
zim function

DESCRIPTION
Makes Math.random() work from a seed.
If set then ZIM rand() and ZIM VEE values will also be seeded with its value.
This means that rand() will repeat in order of its random results.

This allows, for instance, a generative art piece to be the same for a certain user.
Or lets a player replay a same random game level if the seedRandom() is set again with the same seed.
Setting the seedRandom() with no parameter returns to regular rand(), Math.random(), etc.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
seedRandom("hello");
zog(rand(10,100)) // each time the app is run, this will be the same random number between 10 and 100
zog(rand(10,100)) // this will probably be a different random number than the first - but the same each time
zog(rand()) // and this will be the same random number between 0 and 1 not including 1.

EXAMPLE
// Remember the seed for a user with localStorage (like a cookie)
const seed = rand(100000000);
if (localStorage) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (localStorage.seed) seed = localStorage.seed;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else localStorage.seed = seed;
}
seedRandom(seed);
new Circle(100, [red, green, blue]).center();

// the user will always have the same random color
// unless no localStorage or localStorage is cleared

seedRandom(seed);
// below will make another circle the same color as the first
new Circle(100, [red, green, blue]).center().mov(0,300);

seedRandom(); // clears the seed
// below will be a random color each time
new Circle(100, [red, green, blue]).center().mov(0,300);

PARAMETERS
seed - (default null) add any string or number to seed the Math.random()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and subsequently, ZIM rand() and ZIM VEE values from [] and {min, max}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passing in nothing or null will use/reset to regular Math.random()

RETURNS the seed


************************************
[00941] odds(percent)

odds
zim function

DESCRIPTION
Returns true if random percent is within (less than or equal to) the percent parameter provided.
So, odds(20) would be if Math.random() &lt;= .2
and odds(80) would be if Math.random() &lt;= .8
and odds(50) would be half the time.

NOTE: odds(20) is the same as rand() &lt;= .2 but just a little easier to remember and read.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
if (odds(20)) new Rectangle().center(); // 20% the time there will be a Rectangle

if (odds()) asset("yay.mp3").play(); // half the time play yay otherwise play boo
else asset("boo.mp3").play();

PARAMETERS
percent - (default 50) odds() will return true if random percent is less than or equal to this percent

RETURNS a Boolean


************************************
[00975] rarity(weights, shuffle, zimColors, dynamicPayload)

rarity
zim function

DESCRIPTION
Receives an object with properties each having a number value as to their frequency.
Returns an array with these properties multiplied by their frequency.
The array is shuffled so get any element such as the first to pick randomly from the weighted array.
Or pass in to any ZIM VEE value to pick in a weighted manner.
Can also pass into a series() to pick them in order.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const colors = rarity({blue:50, green:40, yellow:10});
zog(colors[0]); // 50% chance blue, 40% chance green, 10% chance yellow

EXAMPLE
const radius = rarity({10:5, 20:2, 30:1});
// The properties are 10, 20 and 30.
// The frequencies are 5, 2 and 1.
// The frequency numbers do not need to add to 100
// These add to 8 - so there is a 5/8 chance the radius is 10
// and 2/8 chance it is 20 and 1/8 chance it is 30

// radius is an array such as [20,10,10,30,10,10,20,10]
// or some such scrambled array
// An array is a ZIM VEE value
// and the radius will be picked randomly from the array
new Circle(radius, red).center();

// instead, a series might be desired:
radius = series(radius);
// this would tile radii of 20,10,10,30,10,10,20,10
new Tile(new Circle(radius, red), 4,2).center()

EXAMPLE
STYLE = {color:rarity(red:99,black:1)}
loop(100, ()=&gt;{
// probably 1 black circle - but very well could be more or less
new Circle(50).loc(rand(W), rand(H));
});

EXAMPLE
// payload array example to easily set scale
// remember that rarity is shuffled automatically so [0] is a random item
const size = rarity({Big:[1,5], Med:[10,1], Small:[1,.5]})[0];
// the first item of each array above is the frequency
// the second item of each array above is the payload
const circle = new Circle(100,red).center().sca(size.payload); // 5, 1 or .5
new Label(size + " Circle").center(circle); // matching "Big", "Med" or "Small"

// otherwise this is the alternative
const size = rarity({Big:1, Med:10, Small:1})[0];
const lookup = {Big:5, Med:1, Small:.5};
const circle = new Circle(100,red).center().sca(lookup[size]); // 5, 1 or .5
new Label(size + " Circle").center(circle); // matching "Big", "Med" or "Small"

EXAMPLE
// ZIM VEE
// the payload example with a range of scales for each size
// and picking randomly from a one of two sets of colors
const size = rarity({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big:[1,{min:4, max:6}], // ZIM VEE range
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Med:[10,{min:.5, max:1.5}],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small:[1,{min:.2, max:.4}]
})[0];
const color = rarity({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grey:[1,[grey,light,tin,silver,moon,fog]], // ZIM VEE random from array
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colored:[20,[pink,purple,blue,red]]
})[0]; // either Grey or Colored
const circle = new Circle(100,color.payload) // will pick from payload array
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.sca(size.payload); // a scale picked from range
new Label(color + " " + size + " Circle").center(circle);

EXAMPLE
// ZIM VEE without dynamicPayload (default)
const damage = rarity({large:[50,{min:20,max:30}], small:[50, {min:5,max:10}]})[0];
// imagine large is picked
zog(damage.payload) // imagine 25.5 is picked
zog(damage.payload) // so this will be 25.5
zog(damage.payload) // this will still be 25.5

// ZIM VEE with dynamicPayload parameter set to true
const damage = rarity({large:[50,{min:20,max:30}], small:[50, {min:5,max:10}]}, null, null, true)[0];
// imagine large is picked
zogr(damage.payload) // imagine 25.5 is picked
zogr(damage.payload) // this picks again - so it could be 22.4
zogg(damage.payload) // and this could be 29.0

damage.dynamicPayload = false; // turn off picking
zogg(damage.payload) // this will be 29.0
zogg(damage.payload) // this will be 29.0

damage.dynamicPayload = true; // back to picking
zogr(damage.payload) // this could be 21.3
zogr(damage.payload) // this could be 28.8

PARAMETERS
weights - (default null) an object literal with options (property name) and frequencies (property value)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the property value can be an array with [frequency, payload] (see further down)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg. {green:70, blue:20, red:10} or {10:2, 20:2, 30:1}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequencies should be whole numbers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequencies can add to 100 to easily visualize percentage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they can add up to any number and this will be used
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to calculate the pick ratio for each one using frequency/total frequency
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance with {10:2, 20:2, 30:1} the frequencies add up to 5
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so the the chances of being picked are 2/5 for 10, 2/5 for 20 and 1/5 for 30
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an array with [frequency, payload] is provided then the frequency is used as the frequency
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the payload is any object that will be added as a payload property to the option string
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(the option is converted from a primative string to a String object so it can hold the payload)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This arrangement replaces the need for a look-up table (see examples)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| ZIM VEE |
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The payload can be any object but will also be processed by ZIM VEE (Pick)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if an array or object literal is desired use {noPick:[]} or {noPick:{}}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also see dynamicPayload parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ZIM VEE literal types are:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
shuffle - (default true) shuffle the resulting array
zimColors - (default true) set to false to not convert "blue" property value to ZIM blue
dynamicPayload - (default false) only pick once from ZIM VEE value in payload
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or set to true to continue to pick from ZIM VEE value in payload each time property is accessed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: at any time after rarity() is called, this can be set to true or false
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
RETURNS an array of properties repeated according to frequency
these properties may have a payload property if payloads are used

[01155] repeats(array, total)

repeats
zim function

DESCRIPTION
Returns the number of repeats in an array.
By default, this will be the max number of repeats - not the total repeats.
The number of repeats often offers a rarity feature.

NOTE: this does not determine the repeated value - this is not needed for rarity.

NOTE: a repeat is one less than the number of objects that are the same.
So if no objects are the same the repeats are 0.
If two objects are the same the repeats are 1.
If three objects are the same the repeats are 2, etc.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const colors = [orange, green, red, orange, orange, green];
zog(repeats(colors)); // 2 - note, one less than the number of objects that repeat
zog(repeats(colors, false)) // 3 - two repeats with orange, one repeat with green

PARAMETERS
array - an array of objects
total - (default false) set to true to return the total repeats
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
RETURNS the max number of repeats in an array or 0 if no objects are the same, one if two objects are the same, etc.
if total is true then returns all the repeats - possibly from different sets


************************************
[01205] series(array|item1|obj, item2, item3)

series
zim function

DESCRIPTION
Returns a function that will return each value passed as a parameter (or an Array) in order
or an object literal with min and max.
This goes in sequence each time the function is called.
Use this to pass a series in to any ZIM VEE value so a looping series is obtained.

NOTE: was called makeSeries() which is now depricated

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// note - do not call the variable name series
const colors = series(red, green, blue);
colors(); // red
colors(); // green
colors(); // blue
colors(); // red, etc.

// or
const colors = [red, green, blue];
const s = series(colors);
s(); // red
s(); // green
s(); // blue
s(); // red, etc.

new Tile(new Rectangle(10,10,[blue, red]), 10, 10).center(); // would randomize colors
new Tile(new Rectangle(10,10,series(blue, red)), 10, 10).center(); // would alternate colors

EXAMPLE
STYLE = {color:series(pink, green, blue)}
loop(9, i=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Circle(100).loc(110+i*100, 400)
});

EXAMPLE
// ten rectangles getting higher by 20 each time
const s = series({min:10, max:200}).step(20);
loop(10, i=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Rectangle(10, s, red).sca(1,-1).loc(100+i*20, 400);
});

EXAMPLE
// added functionality as of ZIM 10.9.0
// start at index 3, reverse and don't go past 0
const nums = series(0, 1, 2, 3, 4).jump(3).reverse().constrain();
loop(5, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zogb(nums()); // 3,2,1,0,0 (blue in console)
});
nums.reverse(false); // go forward - note, still starting at index 0
zogg(nums()); // 0 (green in console)
zogg(nums()); // 1
zogg(nums()); // 2
nums.bounce(); // go back and forth rather than default loop
loop(5, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zogy(nums()); // 3,4,3,2,1 (yellow in console)
});
nums.step(3); // sitting at 0 then increase the step to 3
loop(5, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zogr(nums()); // 0,3,2,1,4 (red in console)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// 3-&gt;6 bounces off 4 with two back to 2
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// 2-&gt;-1 bounces off 0 with one forward to 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// tricky but correct
});
zogp(nums.index); // 1 - coming back 3 steps from 4 to 1 as current index

EXAMPLE
// make a checkerboard
const colors = series(black,white,black,white,black,white,black,white).flip();
const board = new Tile(new Rectangle(80,80,colors),8,8,1,1).center();

PARAMETERS
array|item1|{min,max,step} - the first item - or an array of results that will be called in order as the resulting function is called
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or an object with min, max and step properties to make a series of numbers from and including min and max (step defaults to 0)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will make an array of values and then it is just like an array was entered initially.
when used with ZIM VEE - the values may be further ZIM VEE values (including more series values)
item2 - the second item if the first is not an array
item3 - the third item, etc. to as many items as needed

METHODS
step(num) - num defaults to 1 - the number of items to move the index - or use index property
every(num) - num defaults to 0 - steps to wait before moving to the next index - remain on blue for five, then go to yellow for five, etc.
jump(index) - jump to an index but do not run it - the next call to the series will run here
reverse(boolean) - boolean defaults to true - reverses direction - or pass in false to cancel reverse
bounce(boolean) - boolean defaults to true - back and forth between 0 and length-1 - or pass in false to cancel bounce
flip(boolean) - boolean defaults to true - go to the end then go in reverse - will do last one and first one twice - or pass false to cancel flip
constrain(boolean) - boolean defaults to true - keeps index between 0 and length-1 - or pass in false to cancel constrain
random(boolean) - boolean defaults to true - randomizes order of series each time it finishes - or pass in false to cancel random &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
mix(boolean) - boolean defaults to true - randomizes order of series but avoids duplicating on ends - or pass in false to cancel mix
shuffle(boolean) - boolean defaults to true - shuffles order of series but then will repeat with same order - or pass in false to cancel shuffle

PROPERTIES
type - a string of the type of object in this case, "series"
array - an array of items passed in to the function
length - the length of the series
index - get or set the current index of the series - what will run next
original - a copy of the original order

RETURNS a function that can be called many times - each time returning the next value in the series


************************************
[01501] loop(obj, call, reverse, interval, step, start, end, immediate)

loop
zim function

DESCRIPTION
1. If you pass in a Number for obj then loop() does function call that many times
and passes function call the currentIndex, totalLoops, startIndex, endIndex, obj.
By default, the index starts at 0 and counts up to one less than the number.
So this is like: for (let i=0; i&lt;obj; i++) {}
There are step, start and end index parameters - start cannot be negative

2. If you pass in an Array then loop() loops through the array
and passes the function call the element in the array, currentIndex, totalLoops, startIndex, endIndex and the array.
So this is like: for (let i=0; i&lt;obj; i++) {element = array[i];}

3. If you pass in an Object literal or ZIM Dictionary then loop() loops through the object
and passes the function call the property name, value, currentIndex, totalLoops, startIndex, endIndex, obj
So this is like: for (let i in obj) {property = i; value = obj[i];}
Note: a Dictionary uses a copy of its objects and values to provide name and value
this is because setting Dictionary values while looping will change the order of the arrays while looping

4. If you pass in an String then loop() loops through the letters
and passes the function call the letter, currentIndex, totalLoops, startIndex, endIndex, obj.
So this is like: for (let i=0; i&lt;obj.length; i++) {letter = obj[i];}

5. If you pass an HTML NodeList or HTMLCollection then loop() loops and gives each tag in the NodeList or HTMLCollection
see ZIM zet() for an example of getting a NodeList (like the $() in JQuery)

6. If you pass in a Container then loop() loops through all the children of the container
and does the function for each one passing the child, currentIndex, totalLoops, startIndex, endIndex, obj.
So this is like for(let i=0; i&lt;obj; i++) {let child = obj.getChildAt(i);}
or for (let i in container.children) {let child = container.children[i];}

** the ZIM loop method can also be used for looping through a Container as follows:
container.loop(item=&gt;{}); // see loop under the Methods Module.

NOTE: If you pass in true for reverse, the loop is run backwards counting to 0 (by default)
NOTE: use return to act like a continue in a loop and go to the next loop
NOTE: use return NEXT when in interval mode to go immediately to the next interval - as opposed to return which goes to next but after another interval
NOTE: return a value to return out of the loop completely like a break (and return a result if desired)

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const container = new Container().alp(.1).addTo();
loop(1000, i=&gt;{ // gets passed an index i, totalLoops 1000, startIndex 0, endIndex 999, obj 1000
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// make 1000 rectangles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Rectangle().loc(rand(W-100), rand(H-100), container);
});

// to continue or break from loop have the function return the string "continue" or "break"
loop(10, i=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (i%2==0) return; // skip even
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (i&gt;6) return "break"; // quit loop when &gt; 6
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(i);
});

loop(10, i=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(i); // 9-0 in console
}, true);

loop(10, i=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(i); // 5-9
}, null, 1, 5)

// the start parameter cannot be less than 0
// to get negative values for i subtract a desired value inside the loop

const colors = [green, yellow, pink];
loop(colors, (color, index, start, end, array)=&gt;{ // do not have to collect all these
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(color); // each color
});

const array = [0,0,0,1,0,0,0];
const pass = loop(array, val=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (val!=0) return false;
});
// below will log failed
if (pass) zog("passed"); // by default loop returns true (as of ZIM 10.6.1)
else zog("failed"); // false inside loop gets assigned to pass

const person = {name:"Dan Zen", occupation:"Inventor", location:"Dundas"}
const result = loop(person, (prop, val, index, total, start, end, object)=&gt;{ // do not have to collect all these
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(prop, val); // each key value pair
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (val == "criminal") return "criminal"; // this would return out of the loop to the containing function
});
if (result == "criminal") alert("oh no!");

const tags = zet(".heading").tags; // get an NodeList of tags styled with heading class
loop(tags, (tag, i)=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tag.innerHTML = i + ". " + tag.innerHTML; // add an index number in front
});

EXAMPLE
// LOOP THROUGH A CONTAINER

// LOOP FUNCTION
loop(container, child =&gt; { // gets passed the child, index, total, start, end and obj
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child.alp(rand(.2, .9)); // set each child to a random alpha
});

// LOOP METHOD
container.loop(child =&gt; { // gets passed the child, index, total, start, end and obj
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child.alp(rand(.2, .9)); // set each child to a random alpha
});

// backwards through a Container when removing
container.loop(child =&gt; {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (odds(20)) child.removeFrom();
}, true); // true would reverse - important if removing children in loop

EXAMPLE
// looping with the interval setting

// loop through an array every 1 second
loop(10, i=&gt;{zog(i);}, null, 1);

// loop through a Container every .01 seconds
const tile = new Tile(new Rectangle(26,26,[green, blue, pink]), 10, 10, -1, -1)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.reg(CENTER)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.pos(0,100,CENTER,BOTTOM)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.loop(item=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item.color = darker;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}, null, .01);

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
obj - a Number of times to loop or an Array or Object, String, NodeList or Container to loop through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for looping through a Container also note the loop method: container.loop((child)=&gt;{});
call - the function to call
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the function will receive (as its final parameters) the index, total, start, end, obj, intervalObj (if interval is set)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where the index is the current index, total is how many times the loop will run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;start is the start index, end is the end index and obj is the object passed to the loop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the starting parameters vary depending on the type of obj:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the obj is a number then the first parameter is the index (no extra starting parameters given)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the obj is an array then the first parameter is the element at the current index
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the obj is an object literal then the first and second parameters are the property name and property value at the current index
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the obj is an string then the first parameter is the letter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the obj is an HTMLCollection then the first parameter is the tag
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the obj is a Container then the first paramter is the child
reverse - (default false) set to true to run the loop backwards to 0
interval - (default 0) set to a number of seconds between each loop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use return NEXT to go immediately to the next interval
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use return to just leave current interval then wait another interval to continue
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return a value (other than NEXT) to exit the loop and clear the inverval
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the interval object is provided at the end of the loop function parameters - but will probably not be needed
step - (default 1) each step will increase by this amount (positive whole number - use reverse to go backwards)
start - (default 0 or length-1 for reverse) index to start
end - (default length-1 or 0 for reverse) index to end
immediate - (default true) set to false to not start the loop right away, but rather wait for a first interval

RETURNS any value returned from the loop - or true if no value is returned from a loop

************************************
[01831] getTIME(time, timeType, minWarning, maxWarning, noWarning)

getTIME
global function

Checks for TIME and timeUnit
Used internally by interval, timeout, animate and others
returns the time unit as "s" or "m"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
checkTIME = function(time, timeChar, minWarning, maxWarning)

checkTIME
globalFunction

Tests to see if time is in expected units - timeChar is "s" or "m" for seconds or milliseconds
logs a warning if ((timeChar="s" &amp;&amp; time&gt;minWarning) || (timeChar=="m" &amp;&amp; time&lt;maxWarning))
Set TIMECHECK = false to turn off check if desired - for instance if getting false positives


************************************
[01875] timeout(time, call, pauseOnBlur, timeUnit)

timeout
zim function

DESCRIPTION
Calls a function after the time delay - like window.setTimeout()
This calls ZIM interval() with a total of 1.

NOTE: as of ZIM Cat time is in seconds not milliseconds.
Set TIME = "milliseconds"; to set all ZIM time to milliseconds
or pass in "milliseconds" to the timeUnit parameter for a specific override.

NOTE: setTimeout has the time parameter last, timeout has it first
so that it is consistent with loop() and the CreateJS on() method

NOTE: to clear a timeout you use returnID.clear() - different than window.clearTimeout(returnID)

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
timeout(1, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.x += 100;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});
// moves the circle 100 pixels after one second

// GAME to press button within one second:
const id = timeout(1, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog("you lose!");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;button.enabled = false;
});
const button = new Button().center();
button.on("click", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog("you win!");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;id.clear();
});

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
time - |ZIM VEE| seconds to wait until function is called
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see TIME global constant (defaults to "seconds") can also override with timeUnit parameter set to "milliseconds"
call - function to call when the time passes - will receive the id object as a single parameter
pauseOnBlur - (default false) set to true to pause timeout when window is reduced or another tab gains focus
timeUnit - (default TIME) set to "milliseconds" for traditional JavaScript milliseconds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see TIME constant which defaults to "seconds"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timeUnit will override the TIME constant

RETURNS a ZIM timeoutObject to pause and clear the timeout with the following methods and properties:

METHODS - of ZIM timeoutObject
pause(state, immediate, reset) - (default true) will pause the timeout - set to false to unpause the timeout at the time remaining
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immediate (default false) set to true to make the timeout function run right away when unpausing (no effect when pausing)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reset (default false) set to true to set the timeout back to 0 time passed when unpausing (no effect when pausing)
clear() - will clear the timeout

PROPERTIES - of ZIM timeoutObject
time - the time that has lapsed (in the timeUnit)
paused - the paused state of the timeout
done - true if finished
timeUnit - get the timeUnit used at start

************************************
[01952] interval(time, call, total, immediate, pauseOnBlur, timeUnit)

interval
zim function

DESCRIPTION
Calls a function after each time delay - like window.setInterval().
Can pass in an Array of two times to set random time delays each interval.
Can pass in how many times you want to run the function and whether it runs right away.

NOTE: as of ZIM Cat time is in seconds not milliseconds.
Set TIME = "milliseconds"; to set all ZIM time to milliseconds
or pass in "milliseconds" to the timeUnit parameter for a specific override.

NOTE: setInterval has the time parameter last, interval has it first
so that it is consistent with loop() and the CreateJS on() method

NOTE: to clear a interval you use intervalObj.clear() - different than window.clearInterval(returnID)

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
interval(1, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.x += 100;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S.update();
});
// every second the circle will move 100 pixels
// if you want smooth movement, use:

Ticker.add(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.x += 100; // no need for S.update()
});

interval(1, obj=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog("counting " + obj.count); // starts counting at 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (obj.count == 10) obj.clear(); // will now log 1 to 10
});
// OR better:
interval(1, obj=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog("counting " + obj.count); // starts counting at 1
}, 10); // now will log 1 - 10 with total parameter set to 10

// IMMEDIATE:
interval(1, obj=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog("counting " + obj.count); // starts counting at 0
}, 10, true); // now will log 0 - 9 with immediate parameter set to true

// EXTERNAL control:
const inter = interval(1, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog("counting " + inter.count); // starts counting at 1
});
const button = new Button({label:"STOP", toggle:"START"}).center();
button.on("click", ()=&gt;{inter.pause(button.toggled);});

// RANDOM intervals with ZIM Pick() literals
interval({min:.2, max:.8}, dropBombs); // bombs will fall at different rates between 200ms and 800ms
interval([1, 2], dropBombs); // bombs will fall at either 1 or 2 s
let count = 1;
function increase() {return ++count}
interval(increase, dropBombs); // bombs will fall at 1 second, then again after 2 more seconds and 3 seconds more after that, etc.

PARAMETERS
** supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
** supports VEE - parameters marked with ZIM VEE mean a zim Pick() object or Pick Literal can be passed
Pick Literal formats: [1,3,2] - random; {min:10, max:20} - range; series(1,2,3) - order, function(){return result;} - function
time - |ZIM VEE| (default 1) seconds for the interval (delay until the function runs - again and again)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see TIME global constant (defaults to "seconds") can also override with timeUnit parameter set to "milliseconds"
call - function to call when the interval passes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will be passed a ZIM intervalObject as a single parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same as the return object from animate()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See the Returns section below for methods and properties of the intervalObject
total - (default null - infinite) the number of times the function is called
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: the count property counts intervals but the total property is based on function calls.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total will be equal to the end count with the immediate parameter set to false (default)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the total will be one less than the count if the immediate parameter is true (like an Array index and length)
immediate - (default false) set to true to call the function right away (and then still call every interval)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will not increase the count in the intervalObject because count counts intervals not function calls
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use the provided parameter of the call function to access the intervalObject inside the call function
pauseOnBlur - (default false) set to true to pause interval when window is reduced or another tab gains focus
timeUnit - (default seconds) set to "milliseconds" for traditional JavaScript milliseconds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see TIME constant which defaults to "seconds"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timeUnit will override the TIME constant

RETURNS a ZIM intervalObject to pause and clear the interval with the following methods and properties:

METHODS - of ZIM intervalObject
pause(state, immediate, reset) - (default true) will pause the interval - set to false to unpause the interval with time left
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immediate (default false) set to true to make the interval function run right away when unpausing (no effect when pausing)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reset (default false) set to true to set the interval back to 0 time passed when unpausing (no effect when pausing)
next() - calls the interval again immediately, count goes up
clear() - will clear the interval but the count stays as it was

PROPERTIES - of ZIM intervalObject
time - |ZIM VEE| get or set the time for the interval (see time parameter)
count - get or set the number of times the interval has run (if immediate is true, the first count is 0)
total - get or set the number of times the interval will run if the total parameter is set - otherwise -1 for infinite
paused - get the paused state of the interval (see pause() method)
pauseTimeLeft - if paused, get how much time is left once unpaused

[02140] async(url, callback, callbackString, maxTime, maxCancel)

async
zim function

DESCRIPTION
A way to send data back and forth to a server script without reloading the HTML page.
(like AJAX but without the bother)
Uses a dynamic script call with an optional callback (cross domain calls are okay)
also known as JSON-P pattern but JSON is unnecessary - note, no JSON in two of the examples below.
Pass a url to the server script (ie. php or node page)
and an optional callback function that you define in your code (cannot be an anonymous function).
async will automatically add a random number to the end of your script call to defeat cache.

NOTE: async uses GET so data is limited to GET length (as of ZIM 10 - this is 2K to 8K depending on Browser)
If more data is required, use an AJAX library

NOTE: async uses an r CGI key to send a random number to defeat cache.
Do not send an r property

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// existing JSONp service:
// assuming that we have a callback function called test as shown below
async("http://ip-api.com/json?callback=async.test",test);
function test(data) {zog(data.country);}
// note that the callback we pass the service is async.test not just test
// this allows zim to handle scope issues and garbage collect the dynamic script when done

EXAMPLE
// existing JSON service:
// if the service just returns JSON - then pass through a JSONp wrapper:
const api = "https://zimjs.com/codepen/ranker.php"; // not JSONp - just JSON
async("https://zimjs.org/cdn/jsonp.php?api="+api+"&amp;callback=async.getData", getData);
function getData(data) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(data); // data will be the JSON parsed object
}
See a full example here: https://codepen.io/danzen/pen/gNKQYY
Here is the jsonp.php code if you would like to host:

&lt;?php
$api = $_GET["api"];
if (!preg_match('/^http/i', $api)) exit;
$callback = $_GET["callback"];
header('Content-Type: application/javascript');
$data = file_get_contents($api);
echo $callback."(".$data.")";
?&gt;

EXAMPLE
// CLIENT - your own server script:
// assuming we have a callback function called myFunction as shown below
async("http://yourserver.com/script.php?id=72&amp;name=dan", myFunction);
function myFunction(data){
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(data.test); // wow - assuming you have the PHP file below (JSON is automatically parsed)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(data.score[1]); // 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
}

// SERVER - your script must output the following format as a string:
// "async.myFunction(somedata)"

// in the php file we would use the following to return JSON:
&lt;?php
header('Content-type: text/javascript');
$data = [test=&gt;"wow", score=&gt;[1,2,3]];
echo "async.myFunction(".JSON_encode($data).")";
?&gt;

// or to just echo a string:
&lt;?php
header('Content-type: text/javascript');
echo "async.myFunction('success')"; // your data parameter in myFunction would be "success"
?&gt;

// to return an object literal with nodejs express for example, you would use:
res.send('async.myFunction({list:[1,2,3], name:"whatever"})');
// the data parameter in the myFunction function defined earlier would be an object literal
// we could then do zog(data.list[0]) to log the value 1, etc.

PARAMETERS
url - url to the server script (ie. php or node page)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: async uses an r CGI key to send a random number to defeat cache - do not send an r property
callback - (default null) callback function that you define in your code (cannot be an anonymous function)
callbackString - (default null) a string name matching the function in case the file is minified
maxTime - (default 2 seconds) how long to wait for server response before triggering an error
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may still trigger callback if callback comes later unless maxCancel is set to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see also ZIM TIME constant
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If maxTime is up without calling back the function
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;async will return two arguments to the callback function:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"asyncError" and either "timeout" or "cancelled"
maxCancel - (default false) set to true to have maxTime cancel a late callback response

calling the return function on async does two things:
1. it handles scope issues so we can find your callback function
2. it handles garbage collection to remove the dynamic script tag that was used
if you do not specify a callback function then just send "" back from your server script
NOTE: we have experienced duplicate script calls if nothing is sent back
NOTE: if more than one async() with the same named call function is run at the same time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then a queue of callbacks is created
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the data comes back in a different order, the wrong call could be called
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if there is danger of this happening (rare) then use ZIM Ajax

RETURNS undefined

[02296] couple(json)

couple
zim function

DESCRIPTION
Turns a nested JSON object into a single layer JSON object
The object will have _ between the id and the property name
eg. {"circle":{"x":"10", "y":"20"},"count":{"currentValue":"0"}}
is: {"circle_x":"10", "circle_y":"20", "count_currentValue":"0"}
This allows data to be JSON decoded on the server
and put more directly into table fields of the database

See also ZIM decouple()

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// note the two levels of nesting - this is the format of ZIM Bind data for instance
const test = JSON.stringify({circle:{x:10, y:20},count:{currentValue:0}});
zog(couple(test)); // {"circle_x":"10", "circle_y":"20", "count_currentValue":"0"}

PARAMETERS
json - a JSON string in the nested form of:
{"obj1":{"prop1":"val", "prop2":"val"},"obj2":{"prop3":"val"}}

RETURNS a JSON string with one less level of objects in form of:
{"obj1_prop1":"val", "obj1_prop2":"val", "obj2_prop3":"val"}


************************************
[02341] decouple(json)

decouple
zim function

DESCRIPTION
Turns a flat coupled JSON object into a nested layer JSON object

const test2 = JSON.stringify(test);
const test3 = couple(test);
// {"circle_x":"10", "circle_y":"20", "count_currentValue":"0"}
// send this to server to store in fields

// receive back similar coupled data from fields
// decouple the data:
const test4 = decouple(test3);
// {"circle":{"x":"10", "y":"20"},"count":{"currentValue":"0"}}
const test5 = JSON.parse(test4); // similar object to test!
// {circle:{x:10, y:20},count:{currentValue:0}};

PARAMETERS
json - a JSON string in the coupled form of
{"obj1_prop1":"val", "obj1_prop2":"val", "obj2_prop3":"val"}

RETURNS a JSON string with one less level of objects in the form of:
{"obj1":{"prop1":"val", "prop2":"val"},"obj2":{"prop3":"val"}}

[02962] zimEase(points, polynomials, convert, reverse, lockEnds)

zimEase
zim function

DESCRIPTION
Easing is used in animation usually to slow down or speed up as the animation starts or ends.
ZIM animate() has built in eases that handle the common types of easing - so look there first!
https://zimjs.com/docs.html?item=animate under the ease parameter.

The zimEase() function provides for custom easing beyond the built in eases and
returns an easing function to pass in to ZIM animate() - or CreateJS TweenJS
The points to pass in to zimEase() can be created at https://zimjs.com/ease
At the top of the app there are default easing functions
but just use the built in easing function for most of these such as "quadOut", etc.

SEE: https://zimjs.com/ease for the zimEase tool

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// go to https://zimjs.com/ease use the sliders and TEST the motion
// then press SAVE and copy the zimEase() code into ZIM animate()
// this example makes very big forward, back, forward motion
new Circle().loc(200,200).animate({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props:{x:400},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ease:zimEase([2.5,-0.5,-1,1]),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time:1.5
});

EXAMPLE
// passing an array of two arrays will play the first for the first half
// and the second for the second half
// so here we pass an array of two arrays for a snapInOut effect
// this is cool so it is now a set of eases: "snapIn", "snapOut", "snapInOut" - cheers GreenSock!
new Circle().loc(200,200).animate({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;props:{x:400},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ease:zimEase([[1.45,-0.57,0.67,0.55], [0.34,0.44,1.43,-0.31]]),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// ease:"snapInOut", // or use the new ZIM ease
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time:2
});

PARAMETERS
points - (default [.2,.4,.6,.8]) an array of 4 points to feed the equation - or an array of two arrays
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use the tool at https://zimjs.com/ease and press SAVE to get these
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the two ends are anchored at 0 and 1 and are the input to the quintic Bezier formula
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an array of two arrays is provided the first array is used for the first half of the tween (In)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the second array is used for the second half of the tween (Out)
polynomials - (default null) an array of 5 points that are the results of the quintic Bezier formula
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;linear would be [0,0,0,0,1] - use this if you are given the polynomials - who knows!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise see points.
mirror - (default false) will duplicate the ease equation and reverse the second copy all within the provided time
reverse - (default false) reverses the ease equation (does not work with mirror)
lockEnds - (default true) this snaps the start and end to the real values - set to false to draw curve based on data, for instance.

PROPERTIES
** The function result is an object that holds the easing equation in a noPick property
** this allows it to bypass the dynamic setting of ZIM VEE ease parameter.
** Also in this object are the additional properties
points - the array of points or the array of arrays of points
polynomials - the array of final values or an array of arrays of final values

RETURNS an easing function for ZIM animate() or CreateJS TweenJS

[04023] mobile(orientation)

mobile
zim function

NOTE: for making mobile apps - see https://zimjs.com/mobile.html
and the PWA entry in Docs https://zimjs.com/docs.html?item=PWA

NOTE: as of ZIM version ZIM 01, a global variable M is provided if the Frame is run
that just stores the result of mobile().  mobile() was needed for each Button... so made it global

DESCRIPTION
Detects if app is on a mobile device - if so, returns the mobile device type:
android, ios, blackberry, windows, other (all which evaluate to true) else returns false.
orientation defaults to true and if there is window.orientation then it assumes mobile
BUT this may return true for some desktop and laptop touch screens
so you can turn the orientation check off by setting orientation to false.
If orientation is set to false the check may miss non-mainstream devices
The check looks at the navigator.userAgent for the following regular expression:
/ip(hone|od|ad)|android|blackberry|nokia|opera mini|mobile|phone|nexus|webos/i
Microsoft mobile gets detected by nokia, mobile or phone.

NOTE: See also the ZIM MOBILE constant - this can be set to true or false to override mobile() (but not the M global)

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
if (mobile()) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const pane = new Pane("Desktop Only");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pane.show();
}

// alternatively, for ZIM version ZIM 01 and on:
if (M) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const pane = new Pane("Desktop Only");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pane.show();
}

PARAMETERS
orientation - (default true) uses window.orientation property to determine mobile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this may call certain touch screens mobile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but setting to false uses a test on mobile names which could be incomplete

RETURNS a String or false

************************************
[04088] vee(obj)

vee
zim function

DESCRIPTION
Determines if obj is a ZIM Pick() object or a Pick Literal - used by ZIM VEE parameters
Pick Literal format is [], {min:a, max:b}, function(){}, {noPick:x} or a function(){}
See https://zimjs.com/docs.html?type=Pick
ZIM Pick is a way to pass in dynamic parameters or style properties
This is very handy to pass in a series() function or an array for random pickings, etc.
Used to create dynamic particles with the Emitter or tile specific items in order, etc.
Pick.choose() accepts any value and if not in ZIM Pick format, will just return the object

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const color = [red, green, blue];
// ternary operator - if in Pick format, add "random" else ""
new Label((vee(color)?"random ":"") + "colors").center();

PARAMETERS
obj - an object to pass in to test whether it is in ZIM VEE (Pick) format

RETURNS a Boolean true if Pick format or false if not (such as just a number, string, new Circle, etc.)


************************************
[04121] extend(subclass, superclass, override, prefix, prototype)

extend
zim function - modified CreateJS extend and promote utility methods

DESCRIPTION
For ES5 - place after a sub class to extend a super class.
Extending a super class means that the sub class receives all the properties and methods of the super class.
For example, a ZIM Container() extends a CreateJS Container and then adds more methods and properties
but all the CreateJS Container methods and properties are still there too like x, y, addChild(), etc.

For ES6 - do not use zim.extend() but rather use the built in ES6 structures as follows:

EXAMPLE
// ES6 - do NOT use zim.extend()
class Person() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constructor () {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog("I am a person");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}
class Woman extends Person { // use JS6 extends keyword
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constructor () {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;super(); // use JS6 super() to call the Person constructor - will do the zog()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Woman code
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}

// ES6 to extend a zim Container for example (do NOT use zim.extend() in ES6)
class ChineseCoin extends Container { // use JS6 extends keyword
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constructor () {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;super(); // must call the zim Container before using keyword this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Circle(100, "gold").addTo(this); // this will be the zim Container
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Rectangle(100, 100, "brown").center(this);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}
var coin = new ChineseCoin().center(); // coin is a zim Container with Circle and Rectangle inside

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// ES5 examples using functions to make classes
// ES5 has no extends keyword and no super keyword so we use zim.extends()
function Person() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.talk = function() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog("I am a person");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}
function Woman() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.super_constructor(); // part of the zim.extend() system
}
extend(Woman, Person); // here is the zim.extend() for ES5
var woman = new Woman();
woman.talk();

NOTE: CreateJS display objects require their constructor to be called otherwise it is like quantum entanglement (seriously)
extend() adds access to the super class constructor so it can be called in the subclass as follows:
this.super_constructor();
It also provides access to super class methods that are overridden

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// ES5 example - see the ES6 set of examples for ES6 ;-)
// make a Collection class that will extend a Container
// the Collection class will call the Container constructor
// and override the the ZIM Container center method in the class body
// and override the CreateJS Container addChild method in the prototype
// either method would work in either place - it is often a matter of preference
// but you might need to use a method in the class body to access local variables
// The ZIM extend() method parameter values need to change depending on where you override
// see the comments inline for the instructions

var Collection = function() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// for CreateJS the super constructor must be run
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.super_constructor();

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// override the zim center() method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// methods in the function call that override must be passed in as an array of strings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// to the override parameter of extend() to be able to access the super_method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.center = function(where) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.super_center(where);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.y -= 50;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}
// override the super class addChild() that comes from the CreateJS Container
// methods on the prototype that override are automatically provided a super_method
// unless the prototype parameter of extend() is set to false (default is true)
Collection.prototype.addChild = function(c) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.super_addChild(c); // call the super class addChild
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog("added a child to Collection");
}

// make the Collection extend a Container()
// it will receive all the properties and methods of the Container plus its own
extend(Collection, Container, CENTER); // or pass an array of overridden methods

// use the Collection
var c = new Collection();
c.addChild(new Rectangle(100, 100, green)); // zogs "added a child to Collection"
c.center(); // centers the collection but then offsets it 50 pixels up

NOTE: the superclass constructor is always available as this.prefix_constructor() no matter the override or prototype settings
NOTE: this.prefix_constructor(); should be called at the top of the subclass to avoid problems when multiple copies of object
NOTE: to extend a class that already extends a ZIM class then change the prefix to a unique name:

EXAMPLE
// if we already had the Collection example above and we want to extend that
// then we must use a new prefix when using extend()

var Records = function() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.Collection_constructor();
}
extend(Records, Collection, null, "Collection");

// you will still have this.super_center(), this.super_addChild() if needed
// plus any newly overridden methods available as this.Collection_methodName() etc.
var r = new Records();
r.addChild(new Circle(20, pink));
r.super_center(); // call the original center (without vertical shift)

// to extend again, use yet another prefix - for example: "Records"
var Jazz = function() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.Records_constructor();
}
extend(Jazz, Records, null, "Records");

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
NOTE: do NOT use zim.extend() with ES6 - see ES6 examples at top instead
subclass - the class to extend
superclass - the class to extend from (an existing class)
override - (default null) an Array of methods (as Strings) to override.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can override any function by just defining that function in the subclass
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the override parameter gives you access to the overridden function in the superclass prototype
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only methods on the superclass prototype can be accessed once overridden - not methods in the superclass body
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if there is only one method being overridden then a single string is fine ("test" or ["test"] is fine)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any methods passed to this parameter will be given prefix_methodName() access on the sub class (this.prefix_methodName())
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where the prefix is below (note, the prototype setting has no bearing on these manual overrides)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this list is only needed for methods in the subclass body
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;methods assigned to the prototype of the subclass that override are automatically given prefixes
prefix - (default "super") a prefix that will be followed by "_" and then the overridden method name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by default this.super_constructor() would call the super class constructor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if prefix is set to "Person" then this.Person_constructor() would call the super class constructor
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same system is used to call overridden files in override or prototype
prototype - (default true) will search the subclass prototype for overriding methods
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the overridden methods are then available as this.prefix_methodName()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to false to avoid searching the super class for methods overridden by the sub class prototype
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just quickens the code minutely if there is no need

NOTE: extend() is included in Distill if DISPLAY, METHODS or FRAME Module classes are used (otherwise NOT included)

RETURNS the subclass

[04327] copy(obj, clone, cloneContainers)

copy
zim function

DESCRIPTION
Copies arrays and basic objects:
modified http://stackoverflow.com/users/35881/a-levy
If you have var obj = {prop:"val"};
and then try and copy obj to obj2 like so: obj2 = obj;
then obj2 and obj refer to the same object.
This means that after obj.prop = "new"; both obj.prop and obj2.prop would be "new".
copy(obj) returns a new object so both will work independently
and after obj.prop = "new"; obj2.prop would still be "val".

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const obj = {hair:blue, cars:["audi", "honda"]};
const cop = copy(obj);
cop.hair = "green";
zog(obj.hair, obj.cop); // blue, green
obj.cars.push("vw");
zog(obj.cars.length, cop.cars.length); // 3, 2

// copy with clone for cloneable objects
// without the second parameter as true these obj2[0] and obj3[0] would be the same
// and when we do the second addTo it would just move the circle to the second position
const obj2 = [
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Circle(20,green),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Rectangle(30,30,green),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Triangle(40,40,40,green)
];
const obj3 = copy(obj, true); // copy and clone
obj2[0].addTo(stage).pos(100, 200);
obj3[0].addTo(stage).pos(300, 400);

PARAMETERS
obj - the object to copy
clone - (default false) set to true to clone any cloneable object while copying

isPick
zim function

DESCRIPTION
Returns whether an object is a SPECIAL Pick literal
of type [], {min:val, max:val}, {noPick:val} or function that returns a value
If any other object is passed to Pick, it just gets passed through
So in theory, all objects are in Pick literal format

zog(isPick(function(){})); // false
zog(isPick(function(){return 20;})); // true
const s = series(1,2,3);

[05041] TAU, DEG, RAD, PHI

TAU, DEG, RAD, PHI
zim constants

DESCRIPTION
ZIM degrees and radian constants
If working in radians, TAU is equal to 2 radians (360).
This allows easy visualization of angles - TAU/2 is 180, TAU/4 is 90, etc.
DEG is 180/Math.PI so you multiply a radian value by DEG to get degrees.
RAD is Math.PI/180 so you multiply a degree value by RAD to get radians.
PHI is the golden ratio or Math.pow(5,.5)*.5+.5 or 1.6180339887…
NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
Math.sin(TAU/4); // sin of 90 degrees (1)
// is same as
Math.sin(90*RAD);
// is same as
Math.sin(90*Math.PI/180);
// and
Math.asin(1)*DEG; // is 90


************************************
[05072] smoothStep(num, min, max)

smoothStep
zim function

DESCRIPTION
smoothStep takes an input value and outputs a value between 0 and 1
that represents a transition between the min and max with easing at both ends.
If you want the easing to be more pronounced, then reduce difference between min and max.
If the value falls outside the min or max then it is set to the min or max.
Remember the return value is between 0 and 1 so you can multiply by max-min and add it to min
to get a value at the original scale.
Used to make blobs with Noise(): https://zimjs.com/noise/blobs.html

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// here we use smoothStep to make a gradient between black and white
// not an even one right across but a gradient across a transition zone of 40-100

// create an empty Bitmap size 200, 200 and center it on the stage
const bmp = new Bitmap(null, 200, 200).center();

// we need to loop and get a value for each pixel
// normally we loop across the rows and then do each column
// but here we are making a horizontal gradient
// so we will loop across the x and get the desired value
// then when we loop across the y in the inner loop, we just use that same value
for (let x = 0; x &lt; bmp.width; x++) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// making gradient in x only so calculate smoothStep here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// x will be from 0 to the width of 200
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// we pass in a min of 40 and a max of 100
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// the result of smoothStep is between 0 and 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// so from 0 to 40 the return of smoothStep will be 0
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// and from 100 to 200 the return of smoothStep will be 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// In between, the return value starts off close to 0, then speeds up
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// and then slows down to 1 in a curve that is somewhat like the letter f
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// When we multiply by 255 and apply that result to each color,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// we get black and then a range of greys and then white
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const value = smoothStep(x, 40, 100)*255;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// now we loop down the column for the x position
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (let y = 0; y &lt; bmp.height; y++) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// imageData is four values per pixel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// the red, green, blue and alpha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// in one big long array - each value will be constrained to between 0 and 255
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// this i value will increase by 4 each time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// then we write the same value for red, green, blue to get a shade of grey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let i = (x + y * bmp.width) * 4;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bmp.imageData.data[i] = value; // red (0-255)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bmp.imageData.data[i + 1] = value; // green (0-255)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bmp.imageData.data[i + 2] = value; // blue (0-255)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bmp.imageData.data[i + 3] = 255; // alpha (0-255)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}
bmp.drawImageData(); // draw the imageData to the Bitmap

PARAMETERS
num - the input value with respect to min and max
min - the lower edge for smoothStep (often termed edge0) - anything smaller will be set to min
max - the upper edge for smoothStep (often termed edge1) - anything bigger will be set to max

DESCRIPTION
An AJAX class to send data back and forth to a server without reloading the page

NOTE: also see ZIM async() to send data back and forth as JSONp
using async can avoid various security issues with cross domain access

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// GET - note: GET is limited to approximately 2048 characters
const ajax = new Ajax();
new Button().center().tap(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ajax.get("https://yourserver/ajax.php?record=pressed");
});
&lt;?php
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$record = isset($_GET["record"]) ? $_GET["record"] : "";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// $record would now hold the string "pressed"
?&gt;

EXAMPLE
// GET with user input and server response
const query = new TextArea(300,90).center();
new Button({label:"SUBMIT", corner:5}).sca(.7).pos(0,100,CENTER,CENTER)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.tap(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Ajax().get("https://yourserver/ajax.php?query="+encodeURI(query.text), callback);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var data = {name:"Dr Abstract", occupatio:"creator"};
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// data will automatically have JSON.stringify() applied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var id = "AB234";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ajax.post("https://yourserver/ajax.php", data, "add", id, callback);
});
function callback(data) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(data.name); // "Dr Abstract"
}
&lt;?php
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// ZIM Ajax POST the data is received as a data property:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$data = isset($_POST["data"]) ? $_POST["data"] : "";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// a command can be sent for add, select, update, delete, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$command = isset($_POST["command"]) ? $_POST["command"] : "";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// extra information can be collected such as an id, etc.

?&gt;

EXAMPLE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// put - sends data in body of content
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// same as POST but no command and receive in PHP as follows:
&lt;?php
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// ZIM Ajax put receive as follows:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$array = json_decode(file_get_contents('php://input'), true);
?&gt;

PARAMETERS
master - data to be sent with every get() or post() (not put())
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this can be collected in php, for example, as $GET_["master"] or $POST_["master"]
couple - (default false) - set to true to turn nested JSON into a single layer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** for POST only - use ZIM couple() and decouple() manually with GET and PUT
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see ZIM couple() and decouple() for more information
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data for POST will be coupled when sent and uncoupled when received
lock - (defualt null) send an optional lock id - would need to be processed on the server
unique - (defualt null) send an optional unique=true - would need to be processed on the server

METHODS
get(url, call) - send and receive based on GET (approximate limit 2048 characters)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the url will have parameters in cgi format to send information
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for example: "server.php?name="+encodeURI("Dr Abstract")+"&amp;occupation=creator";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in PHP access these with $_GET["name"], $_GET["occupation"], etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call is the function to call and will receive (data, error) as parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the data will automatically have JSON.parse() applied if in JSON format
post(url, data, command, extra, call) - send and receive based on POST
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** accepts the ZIM DUO technique of regular parameters or a configuration object with properties matching parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;url is the url to a server script such as php or node
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the url will not need parameters but rather use the data, command and extra
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data will automatically have JSON.stringify() applied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in PHP access this with $data = $_POST["data"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;often, we might store this directly as JSON in the database
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but it can be split up and put in fields as follows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$assoc = json_decode($data, true); // true for assoc array if desired
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command is what to do with the data and will be encodeURI sent as variable command
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so for instance receive $command = $_POST["command"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this could have a value of "select", "add", "update", "delete", etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extra is any extra filter information and will be encodeURI sent as variable extra
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so for instance receive $extra = $_POST["extra"];
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this could be an id or a search term
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call is the function to call and will receive (data, error) as parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the data will automatically have JSON.parse() applied if in JSON format
put(url, data, call) - send and receive based on PUT
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put sends data in the body of the file
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the url will not have parameters but rather use the data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the data will automatically have JSON.stringify() applied
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in PHP access this with: $array = json_decode(file_get_contents('php://input'), true);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call is the function to call and will receive (data, error) as parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the data will automatically have JSON.parse() applied if in JSON format

PROPERTIES
master - get or set the master data being sent with each get() or post() (not put())
couple - get or set whether the POST data is coupled when sent and uncoupled when received (not get() and put())
lock - get or set the lock data being sent with each get() or post() (not put())


************************************
[05407] Noise(seed)

Noise
zim class

DESCRIPTION
Noise creates OpenSimplex Noise: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSimplex_noise
Converted from https://www.npmjs.com/package/open-simplex-noise
See examples at https://zimjs.com/noise/
In general, this is special noise where the pixels relate to one another in a complex way.
This connection, lets us do things like create terrains or blobs, etc. that look organic.
There is 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D noise where we pass in one value, two values, three values and four values.
We always get back a number between -1 and 1 and this result relates to the results around it.

1D - we can plot 1D by drawing line segments across the stage (x) and setting the y value to the result of simplex1D(x)
This makes a 2D mountain-like terrain across the stage

2D - if we keep the plot from the 1D but use 2D and change the second parameter, we can animate the line.
We just need to adjust the second parameter by a very small amount each time such as .005.
Or we can plot put the return value of simplex2D onto its x,y matching location in a Bitmap
mapping it to a greyscale to make a traditional noise pattern.
We can adjust the "size" of the noise by dividing the x and y values (frequency).
If we use the ZIM smoothStep() function we can smoothen these to make blobs.
We can also use the return value as height for 3D terrain.

3D - if we keep the traditional noise/blob pattern from the 2D but use simplex3D and animate the third parameter,
we can animate the 2D noise in time which looks great when we animate blobs!
This plotting is thousands of computations and will bog the computer if too big.

4D - will allow us to animate 3D values, etc.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// 1D Noise to make a jagged line across the stage
const noise = new Noise();
const shape = new Shape(W, H)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.addTo().s("black").ss(2).mt(0, H/2);
loop(W/50, i=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shape.lt((i+1)*50, H/2 + noise.simplex1D(i)*200);
});
// the above can be animated by using simplex2D and animating the second number by small amounts

EXAMPLE
// 2D noise
// create a Noise object:
const noise = new Noise();

// create an empty Bitmap size 200, 200 into which to draw the noise
const bmp = new Bitmap(null, 200, 200).center();

// we fill the bitmap starting from top left going across in the inner loop,
// then down, then across, etc. until we get to bottom right.
for (let y = 0; y &lt; bmp.height; y++) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (let x = 0; x &lt; bmp.width; x++) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// the noise methods return a number from -1 to 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// by adding 1 we get a number between 0 and 2 and we divide by 2 to get 0-1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// and we multiply this by 255 to get a number between 0 and 255
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let value = (noise.simplex2D(x,y)+1)/2 * 255;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// imageData is one big array with four values per pixel
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// the red, green, blue and alpha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// each value will constrained to between 0 and 255
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// the i value is how many on the current row plus the columns from the previous rows
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// and we set it to increase by 4 each time giving us a place for each color and alpha
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// We write the same value for red, green, blue to get a shade of grey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let i = (x + y * bmp.width) * 4;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bmp.imageData.data[i] = value; // red (0-255)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bmp.imageData.data[i + 1] = value; // green (0-255)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bmp.imageData.data[i + 2] = value; // blue (0-255)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bmp.imageData.data[i + 3] = 255; // alpha (0-255)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}
bmp.drawImageData(); // this draws the imageData to the Bitmap

// Here is the same example to get blobs using smoothStep:

const f = 25; // try changing this number around

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (let x = 0; x &lt; bmp.width; x++) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let value = (noise.simplex2D(x/f, y/f)+1)/2; // 0-1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// smoothStep sets less than .3 to 0 and greater than .35 to 1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// and transitions between using an easing formula in the shape of an f
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value = smoothStep(value, .3, .35) * 255;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let i = (x + y * bmp.width) * 4;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bmp.imageData.data[i] = value; // red (0-255)

[06035] Bezier(a, b, c, d)

Bezier
zim class

DESCRIPTION
Creates data for a Cubic Bezier to give x and y at a ratio of the curve
Also gives mx and my for a modified x and y that is more evenly spaced
Thanks Ivo Wetzel - StackExchange
Used internally by zim.getCurvePoint() used by Squiggle, Blob, Beads, and animate() in path

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const a = {x:100, y:100}; // start point
const b = {x:400, y:100}; // control point for start point
const c = {x:100, y:300}; // control point for end point
const d = {x:300, y:300}; // end point
const bezier = new Bezier(a,b,c,d);
new Shape().s(black).mt(a.x,a.y).bt(b.x,b.y, c.x,c.y, d.x,d.y).addTo();
loop(10, i=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// original spacing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// new Circle(5).loc(bezier.x(i/10), bezier.y(i/10));

[06153] Boundary(x|bounds, y, width, height)

Boundary
zim class

DESCRIPTION
Stores the data for a rectangle with x, y, width and height.
Can be used with ZIM drag(), gesture() for boundaries
and the Physics module for world boundary.

NOTE: A createjs.Rectangle or an object {} with x, y, width and height properties can also be used
Boundary was introduced to reduce confusion over having a ZIM Rectangle (Shape) and a CreateJS Rectangle (data)

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
new Circle(100, blue)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.drag(new Boundary(0,0,W,H));
// note: drag and gesture used to have rect parameters
// these have now been depreciated and replaced with boundary parameters

// CONTRACT
// the drag() boundary contains the registration point
// note: the gesture() boundary contains the whole shape of the object
// here, we keep the circle inside the stage by contracting the Boundary by the radius
var radius = 100;
new Circle(radius, red)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.drag(new Boundary(0,0,W,H).contract(radius));

PARAMETERS
x|bounds - the x position of the Boundary
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or pass in an object with {x,y,width,height} - such as obj.getBounds()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this allows manipulation with contract if desired
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at which point, the other parameters are ignored
y - the y position of the Boundary
width - the width of the Boundary
height - the height of the Boundary

PROPERTIES
x - the x position of the Boundary
y - the y position of the Boundary
width - the width of the Boundary
height - the height of the Boundary

METHODS
contract(number|x, y, width, height) - number of pixels to make the Boundary smaller
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passing in a single number will contract this on all sides
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passing in two numbers will contract from horizontal and vertical accordingly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passing in four numbers will contract from the sides accordingly (left, top, right, bottom)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: to expand pass in a negative number
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns object for chaining

[06243] GradientColor(colors, ratios|angle, x0, y0, x1, y1)

GradientColor
zim class

DESCRIPTION
Creates data for a Linear Gradient that can be used to color ZIM Shapes
like Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, Squiggle, Blob, Flare
and therefore all ZIM component background colors, etc.
Also see ZIM RadialColor and BitmapColor classes

NOTE: the base ZIM Shape class will need gradients applied as usual

NOTE: The chainable methods for linearGradient() and radialGradient() are depricated

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// linear gradient from pink to purple across whole gradient
// with the start at 0,0 and end at 0,500 - so from top to bottom
new Rectangle(1000, 500, new GradientColor([pink,purple], [0,1], 0,0, 0,500)).addTo();

// alternatively, a short version is provided
// this makes the gradient across the object at 90 degrees - so pointing down as 0 points to the right
new Rectangle(1000, 500, new GradientColor([pink,purple],90)).addTo();

EXAMPLE
// linear gradient with 30% pink transitioning to green at half way then to 30% pure pink
// along a horizontal path from 0 to 1000 in width
// could also go diagonal for instance 0,0,1000,500
new Rectangle(1000, 500, new GradientColor([pink,green,purple], [.3,.5,.7], 0,0, 1000,0)).addTo();

// alternatively, a short version is provided
// this makes the gradient across the object at the default 0 degrees - so pointing right
// so the angle can be provided instead of the the ratios as in the previous example
// or the angle can be provided after the ratios to replace the x and y values
new Rectangle(1000, 500, new GradientColor([pink,green,purple], [.3,.5,.7], 0).addTo();
// or better yet as the default angle is 0:
new Rectangle(1000, 500, new GradientColor([pink,green,purple], [.3,.5,.7]).addTo();

PARAMETERS
colors - an Array of colors for the gradient, can be more than two
ratios|angle - an Array of 0-1 numbers reprenting the start position of transitions for the colors above
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or an angle with 0 (default) goes from left to the right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 would angle down slightly from left to right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-20 would angle up slightly from left to right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90 would point straight down
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;180 would go from right to left
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;270 or -90 would go from the bottom to the top
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if an angle is provided then x0,x1,y0,y1 is ignored
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the size of the object's bounds is used to scale the gradient
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if no value or an angle is provided the ratios will be divided evenly across the colors
x0|angle - the x position to start the gradient
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if no further parameter values are provided then this will be the angle
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see the ratios|angle parameter for information on angle
y0 - the y position to start the gradient
x1 - the x position to end the gradient
y1 - the y position to end the gradient

PROPERTIES
type - the type of color as a String

and therefore all ZIM component background colors, etc.
Also see ZIM GradientColor and BitmapColor classes

NOTE: the base ZIM Shape class will need gradients applied as usual

NOTE: The chainable methods for linearGradient() and radialGradient() are depricated

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE

// or a shortened version is provided:
new Circle(200, new RadialColor([pink,purple])).center();

// this shortened version also works
new Circle(200, new RadialColor([pink,green,purple], [0,.2,1])).center();

// this shortened version will apply the gradient out to the corners of the rectangle
new Rectangle(200, 400, new RadialColor([pink,purple])).center();

EXAMPLE
// radial gradient from dark to light with alpha reduced
// start fading the light right away to 30% the gradient then use the dark
// move the center of the dark right and up and bigger than radius
// move the center of the light right and up and at 0
// this makes a moon with the dark shade at the bottom left
new Circle(100, new RadialColor(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;["rgba(0,0,0,.2)","rgba(255,255,255,.2)"],[0,.3], 50,-30,120, 40,-40,0)

[06419] BitmapColor(image, repetition, matrix)

BitmapColor
zim class

DESCRIPTION
Creates data for a Bitmap fill from a loaded asset
that can be used to color ZIM Shapes
like Circle, Rectangle, Triangle, Squiggle, Blob, Flare
and therefore all ZIM component background colors, etc.
Also see ZIM GradientColor and RadialColor classes

See: https://youtu.be/xgXVRSVVJTw?t=861

NOTE: the base ZIM Shape class will need a bitmap fill applied as usual

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const assets = "flecks.jpg";
const path = "assets/";
new Frame(scaling, width, height, color, outerColor, ready, assets, path);
function ready() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Rectangle(W, H, new BitmapColor("flecks.jpg")).addTo();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// or use asset("flecks.png") instead of string "flecks.jpg" - but ZIM will figure it out
}

PARAMETERS
image - a ZIM Bitmap() such as available with Pic() or asset()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when asset is loaded with ZIM Frame or F.loadAssets()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also accepts the string name of an asset that would go in the new Pic() or asset()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may accept url to html image but image needs to be loaded first
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so would recommend usual ZIM asset loading
repetition - (default "repeat") the repeat of the Bitmap fill
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also "repeat-x", "repeat-y" or "no-repeat"
matrix - a transformation matrix to apply to the Bitmap

PROPERTIES
type - the type of color as a String
** the above parameters are all available as properties
** but will not change objects with their color already set


************************************
[06473] Damp(startValue, damp)

Damp
zim class

DESCRIPTION
Damping emulates things slowing down due to friction.
The movement heads towards the right value and looks organic.
This is similar if not the same as easing out when tweening.
Create your Damp object outside an interval or Ticker
then inside an interval or ticker call the convert method.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const d = new Damp(parameters);
setInterval(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dampedValue = d.convert(desiredValue);
}, 100);

you would then apply that desired value to a property such as x or y or scale
if you want to do both x and y then you need two Damp objects
and two convert calls (you can do both in one interval or ticker)

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle();
circle.center();
const dampX = new Damp(circle.x);
const dampY = new Damp(circle.y);
// start moving once mouse enters stage
// this event will only run once (the last parameter is true)
S.on("stagemousemove", start, null, true);
function start() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ticker.add(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.x = dampX.convert(F.mouseX);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.y = dampY.convert(F.mouseY);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
}

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
startValue - (default 0) start object at this value and then start damping
damp - (default .1) the damp value with 1 being no damping and 0 being no movement

METHODS
convert(value) - converts a value into a damped value
immediate(value) - immediately goes to value and returns the Damp object

PROPERTIES
damp - can dynamically change the damping (usually just pass it in as a parameter to start)
lastValue - setting this would go immediately to this value (would not normally use)

************************************
[06542] Proportion(baseMin, baseMax, targetMin, targetMax, factor, targetRound, clamp)

Proportion
zim class

DESCRIPTION
Proportion converts an input value to an output value on a different scale.
(sometimes called a map() function)
For instance, like a slider controlling the scale of an object or sound volume.
Make a Proportion object and then in an interval, ticker or event,
convert the base value to the target value using the convert method.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
F.loadAssets("mySound.mp3");
F.on("complete", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// must have also interacted with app before playing sound
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const sound = new Aud("mySound.mp3").play();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const p = new Proportion(0, 10, 0, 1);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const dial = new Dial(); // default range of 0 to 10
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dial.currentValue = 10;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dial.on("change", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sound.volume = p.convert(dial.currentValue);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}); // end of dial change
}); // end sound loaded

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
baseMin - min for the input scale (say x value)
baseMax - max for the input scale (say x value)
targetMin - (default 0) min for the output scale (say volume)
targetMax - (default 1) max for the output scale (say volume)
factor - (default 1) is going the same direction and -1 is going in opposite direction
targetRound - (default false) set to true to round the converted number
clamp - (default true) set to false to let results go outside min and max range

METHODS
convert(input) - will return the output property (for instance, a volume)

NOTE: the object always starts by assuming baseMin as baseValue
just call the convert method right away if you want it to start at a different baseValue
for instance, if your slider went from 100 to 500 and you want to start at half way
make the object and call p.convert(300); on the next line

************************************
[06622] ProportionDamp(baseMin, baseMax, targetMin, targetMax, damp, factor, targetRound, clamp)

ProportionDamp
zim class

DESCRIPTION
ProportionDamp converts an input value to an output value on a different scale with damping.
Works like Proportion Class but with a damping parameter.
Damping needs constant calculating so do not put in mousemove event.
The below example scales the circle based on the mouse height.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const circle = new Circle(50, red);
circle.center(); // center method added in ZIM 4TH
const pd = new ProportionDamp(0, H, 0, 5, .2);
Ticker.add(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circle.sca(pd.convert(S.mouseV)); // scale method added in ZIM 4TH
}, stage);

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
baseMin - min for the input scale (say x value)
baseMax - max for the input scale (say x value)
targetMin - (default 0) min for the output scale (say volume)
targetMax - (default 1) max for the output scale (say volume)
damp - (default .1) the damp value with 1 being no damping and 0 being no movement
factor (default 1) is going the same direction and -1 is going in opposite direction
targetRound (default false) set to true to round the converted number

METHODS
convert(input) - converts a base value to a target value
immediate(input) - immediately uses the input to set the target value (no damping) and returns the ProportionDamp object
immediateValue(input) - immediately sets the target value (no damping) and returns the ProportionDamp object
dispose() - clears interval

PROPERTIES
damp - can adjust this dynamically (usually just pass it in as a parameter to start)

NOTE: the object always starts by assuming baseMin as baseValue
if you want to start or go to an immediate value without easing then
call the pd.immediate(baseValue) method with your desired baseValue (not targetValue)

************************************
[06751] Dictionary(unique)

Dictionary
zim class

DESCRIPTION
An object that uses objects as keys to give values.
Similar to an object literal with properties except the property names are objects instead of strings.
JavaScript currently does not have a dictionary, but other languages do.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const o = {test:"test"};
const f = function(w) {zog(w)};
const c = new Circle();
const d = new Dictionary();
d.add(o, 1); d.add(f, 2); d.add(c, f);
zog(d.at(o)); // 1
zog(d.at(f)); // 2
d.at(c)("hello"); // hello
d.remove(o); // to clear o
zog(d.length); // 2

EXAMPLE
const d = new Dictionary();
d.add(circle, "one");
d.add(circle, "two");
zog(d.at(circle)); // two - just the latest but "one" is still there
for (let i=0; i&lt;d.length; i++) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (d.objects[i] == circle) zog(d.values[i]); // one then two
}
// note, loop backwards to clear values at a key

EXAMPLE
// with unique property add(key, val) removes the last val at that key
const d = new Dictionary(true);
d.add(circle, "one");
d.add(circle, "two");
zog(d.at(circle)); // two - and now only two is there
for (let i=0; i&lt;d.length; i++) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (d.objects[i] == circle) zog(d.values[i]); // two
}
// note, now d.remove(key) removes that unique entry for the key

PARAMETERS
unique (default false) - set to true to only accept a single entry (the last added) for a key

METHODS
add(object, value) - adds a value that can be retrieved by an object reference
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if unique is false, this will not overwrite previous entries at the object key
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if unique is true, this will overwrite previous entries at the object key
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;value is optional and will default to true
at(object) - retrieves the last value stored at the object (or returns null if not there)
remove(object) - removes the last value at the object from the Dictionary returns boolean success
clear() - removes all objects from Dictionary - returns object for chaining
dispose() - deletes Dictionary object

PROPERTIES
type - the type of the object as a string
length - the number of items in the Dictionary
unique - whether the dictionary will overwrite values (going from false to true will not delete previous values)
objects - array of keys
values - array of values synched to keys


************************************
[06872] Hierarchy(input)

Hierarchy
zim class

DESCRIPTION
A hierarchy is a nested structure for organized data (like XML).
For instance, Hierarchy manages the accordion feature of ZIM List()
where the list can be expanded and collapsed to show nested sections.

HOW IT WORKS
There are two formats that can be used as input.
Each will create a data property in final hierarchy format.

A. The SIMPLE input is an easier format to write but
has a limitation in that identifiers must be strings.
The Hierarchy replaces the identifiers with sequential ids
and stores the original identifiers as an obj property.

B. The COMPLEX input starts off like the final hierarchy data
which has the advantage of storing any type of object in the hierarchy.
The disadvantage is the ids must be hand coded and it is longer.
The Hierarchy will add level, open and opened properties
and create the data property in final hierarchy format.

STRATEGY
The complex format is tricky.
One way to deal with it is to pass in a SIMPLE string version.
Then replace the strings with final objects in the data property.
The Hierarchy class is used internally by ZIM so may not be needed.
However, it will help for custom tree menus, mindmaps, etc.

As of ZIM 014 Hiearchy data can be edited
using insertBefore(), insertAfter(), replaceItem() and removeItem()
If used for a List, then the List can be recreated with the new data
See: https://zimjs.com/014/hierachy.html

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE - SIMPLE INPUT
let simple;

// 1. Here is linear input as an array - a boring tree - more like grass!
simple = [1,2,3,4]; // so we would probably not use Hierarchy for this.

// 2. To hold nested data we use an object literal.
// The properties can hold linear arrays as values
// but if any of the values need to hold more values then use an object literal:
simple = {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"linear":[1,2,3,4], // an array is okay as all items are leaf nodes (end nodes)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"nested":{ // an object literal is required as one or more items hold other items
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A":[], // this holds nothing (a leaf node) but still needs an empty array
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"B":["one", "two", "three"], // this holds a linear list - all leaf nodes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"C":{ // this holds another nested list where at least one item holds more
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"LEAF":[],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"LINEAR":[1,2,3,4],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"LEAF":[]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}

// If EXTRA info is desired this can be handled like so:
// Set the values as a list property of an object and add any extra properties desired
// The extra property does not have to be called extra and there can be multiple extra properties
// Avoid calling the properties list, obj, level, open or opened.
// The extra properties will be added to the complex data objects (see below)

simple = {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"linear":{list:[1,2,3,4], extra:"val"},
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"nested":{list:{ // an object literal is required as one or more items hold other items
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A":[], // this holds nothing (a leaf node) but still needs an empty array

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}, extra:"val"}
}


// pass the object into the input parameter:
const hierarchy = new Hierarchy(simple);
const data = hierarchy.data;

// data will be the following - note it is a more complex format

};
const hierarchy = new Hierarchy(complex);
const list = new List({list:hierarchy.data, align:CENTER}).center();

PARAMETERS
input (default null) - a simple formated input - see the examples
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will be turned in to a more complex object literal available as the data property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR input a complex formated input - similar to the data property output
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but only ids, obj and list properties are required.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main purpose of Hierarchy is to create the complex data object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but passing in a complex format allows objects other than strings to be used.

METHODS
processSimple(input) - enter simple input - returns a Hierarchy data object literal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is what the Hierarchy does when a simple input is provided to make its data property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the input must be in the simple format as described in the SIMPLE example.
processComplex(input) - enter complex input - returns a Hierarchy data object literal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is what the Hierarchy does when complex data is provided to make its data property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;processComplex will add level, open, and opened properties to the data
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise data must be in the same format as the final data property - see COMPLEX example
getLinearList(list) - enter final list from the data format, to get a linear list of top level objects
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all open list objects within according to the open property
getLinearIds(list) - enter final list from the data format, to get a linear list of top level ids
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all open lists ids within according to the open property
getData(id) - find the final data format for a given Hierarchy ID - eg. id0, id12, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass the data.list to the getLinearList() and getLinearIDs() methods
getNextSibling(id) - gets the id of the next sibling - skipping ids of any children
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will find parents next sibling if last child in parent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or undefined if last child in hierarchy
getPrevSibling(id) - gets the id of the previous sibling - skipping ids of any children
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will find the parent if first child in parent
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or undefined if first child in hierarchy
getParent(id) - gets the parent object of the item at the id or null if no parent
insertBefore(items, id, innerItems) - insert item or an array of items before an id with optional children
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will insert at the same level as the id - also see insertAfter()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can pass in an array for items such as ["TEST", "TEST2"]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can pass in a third parameter for children of a single item
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third parameter can also be an array but if there is a third parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and if the first parameter is a list then it only uses the first item in the list
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the parent for the third parameter.
insertAfter(items, id, innerItems) - insert item or an array of items after an id with optional children
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will insert at the same level as the id - also see insertBefore()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can pass in an array for items such as ["TEST", "TEST2"]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can pass in a third parameter for children of a single item
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third parameter can also be an array but if there is a third parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and if the first parameter is a list then it only uses the first item in the list
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the parent for the third parameter.
replaceItem(item, id) - replace the current item at the id with the provided item
removeItem(id) - remove the item at the id

PROPERTIES
data - a hierarchy formated object literal with ids that hold object literals
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ids are in the format of id0, id1, id2, etc. numbered in order of creation (top to bottom)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the object literals have obj, level, open, opened and list properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leaf nodes (end nodes) will have {} as its list property value
length - read only total length of all nodes

[07328] Pick(choices)

Pick
zim class

HISTORY
Pick was originally zik() and ZIM VEE (introduced in ZIM 5) throughout the ZIM documentation
It was so handy that a general (non ZIM centric) name has been given to a class
that can be used by other libraries and languages.
See https://github.com/danzen/Pick for the complete general code and description

DESCRIPTION
Pick() provides a system to handle dynamic parameters.
It does so by providing formats for options and a choose() method to pick from the options.

For example, a particle emitter has an obj parameter to receive what type of particle to emit.
If a particle were randomly chosen from a rectangle, circle or triangle and passed into obj
then the emitter would only emit the randomly chosen particle - say, a bunch of triangles.
What is desired is that the emitter emit rectangles, circles and triangles randomly.
Pick() provides a way to pass in all three shapes and have the emitter choose each time it emits.

FORMATS
The Pick() formats handle:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. a random selection: [blue, green, yellow] - array format
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. a random range: {min:10, max:30} - range object format (plus integer and negative)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. a series: series(10,20,30) - series format also Pick.series()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. a function result: function(){return new Date().minutes} - function format
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. a normal value: 7 or "hello" - single-value format
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. a noPick object: {noPick:["real", "array"]} - escape format
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. a combination: [{min:10, max:20}, 30, 40] - combination format (recursive)

NOTE: the range format gets passed to ZIM rand() directly so see docs there
there are also integer and negative parameters both defaulting to false

PICK LITERAL
Formats are passed in to a Pick() object and the Pick object can be passed to a class or function parameter
In ZIM, the formats may be passed directly into the class or function parameter (as a Pick literal)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Circle(new Pick([10,20]), red); // Pick()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Circle([10,20], red); // Pick Literal
** The literal can run into conflicts such as for a ZIM corner parameter which accepts an array []
This would be avoided with a system always using Pick() and never the literal.
But... ZIM started off without the formalized Pick - and the literal is shorter ;-)
The conflict can be resolved by using {noPick:[]} and then the array is not picked from.

NOTE: Pick is used internally by by zim.interval, zim.animate, zim.Emitter, zim.Pen, etc.
as well as ZIM STYLE and ZIM Shape basic parameters handy for cloning with Tile, Emitter, etc.

EXAMPLE
let loopCount, choice;

loopCount = new Pick([1,2,3]);
choice = Pick.choose(loopCount); // 1, 2, or 3

loopCount = [1,2,3]; // Pick literal
choice = Pick.choose(loopCount); // 1, 2, or 3

choice = Pick.choose([1,2,3]); // 1, 2, or 3

const rotation = {min:10, max:20, integer:false, negative:true};
// an example of a Range object - this will give values between -20 and -10 or 10 and 20
// rotation now holds an object as to how to pick its value
// this can be passed into a zim.Emitter() for instance
// which will make multiple copies and rotate them based on Pick.choose()
// or this can be passed into an animation object
// and then into zim.Emitter() for the animate parameter

const emitter = new zim.Emitter({
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obj:new Rectangle(),
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;random:{rotation:rotation} // the emitter will use Pick.choose() to pick a rotation for each particle
});

function age() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// assuming user.age is some input value that exists
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (user.age &gt;= 18) return ["a", "b", ["c","d"]];
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else return ["e", "f"];
}
// below will be a, b, c or d if user is 18+ with a and b having more of a chance
// or e or f if not over 18
const show = Pick.choose(age);

// below we randomize the tile colors in the first example
// and make them in color order for the second example
new Tile(new Rectangle(10,10,[blue, red]), 10, 10).center(); would randomize colors
new Tile(new Rectangle(10,10,series(blue, red)), 10, 10).center(); would alternate colors

// here we pass an array through without processing the array:
Pick.choose({noPick:[1,2,3,4,5]}); // result is [1,2,3,4,5]

// a range between one and three seconds - repeating after 3 choices
const pick = new Pick({min:1, max:3}).num(3);
interval(pick, function () {console.log("calling");}); // eg. 2.5s, 2.7s, 1.2s, 2.5s, 2.7s, 1.2s, etc.

PARAMETERS
choices - any of the ZIM Pick formats:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. an array of choices to choose from randomly
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. a range object with min and max (integer and negative) properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. a zim.series() or Pick.series() to pick objects in order
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. a function that returns a result
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. a single not one of the above that passes through
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. an escape object with a noPick property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. any combination of the above to pick recursively

METHODS
num(number) - a chainable method to limit the number of options until Pick.choose() will repeat like a series
loop(number, call(value, index, total)) - a way to loop through options
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number is the number of times to loop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call is a callback function that gets called each loop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the callback will recieve a value (the choice), the index of the loop and the total (the number parameter)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inside the function a return is like a continue and a return of any value is like a break in traditional for loops.

STATIC METHODS
Pick.choose(Pick Object or Pick Literal) - gets a value from the Pick object or Pick Literal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so chooses from a random array, or range, or gets the next in the series, etc.
Pick.rand(a, b, integer, negative) - gets a random number - same as zim.rand()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a - the first Number for the range
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a and b are not provided, rand() acts like Math.random()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if parameter b is not provided, rand will use range 0 to and including a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b - (default 0) second Number for the range
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it does not matter if a&gt;b or a&lt;b
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;integer - (default true) set to false to include decimals in results
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if false, range will include decimals up to but not including the highest number
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a or b have decimals this is set to false
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;negative - (default false) includes the negative range as well as the positive
Pick.series(array|item1, item2, item3, etc.) - same as zim.series()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns a function that can be called many times each time returning the next value in the series (eventually looping)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;array|item1 - the first item - or an array of results that will be called in order as the resulting function is called
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item2 - the second item if the first is not an array
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;item3 - the third item, etc. to as many items as needed
Pick.getMinMax(ZIM VEE value) - returns a {min:val, max:val} object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the min and max values the ZIM VEE value can return
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or null, null if not numbers or the ZIM VEE is a function
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will work for a range object {min, max}, an array of number [] or a series() of numbers

PROPERTIES
type - the type of object as a String
choices - a reference to the choices object provided as the Pick(choices) parameter

zil
global function

DESCRIPTION
Stop keys from moving content - arrows, spacebar, pgup, pgdown, home, end.
Stop scroll wheel from moving content - scrolling the canvas for instance.
ZIM Frame does this in the full, fit and outside scale modes.
If not using Frame, then you can do this once at the start of your code.
Returns an array of references to three listeners: [keydown, wheel and DOMMouseScroll].
Use these to removeEventListeners.
Also stores these on Window at window.zilK, window.zilW, window.zilS.
The arrows, etc, still work but just not their default window behaviour.

EXAMPLE
// at the top of your code
let listenersArray = zil();
// key and mousewheel arrows, spacebar, etc.
// will have their default actions stopped until you remove the listeners:
// window.removeEventListener("keydown", listenersArray[0]); // etc.

zet(selector).on(type, function) - a shortcut for addEventListener() and will be added to all tags matching the selector
zet(selector).off(type, function) - a shortcut for removeEventListener() and will be remove from all tags matching the selector
zet(selector).css(property, value) - gets and sets styles
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- gets the first programmatic property if a single string property is passed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- sets the property to the value on each of the Zet's tags from the selector passed to zet()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- if an object of properties and values is passed as the single parameter then sets all these properties
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- NOTE: style names do not need quotes unless the dash is used - so camelCase does not require quotes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- NOTE: remember that commas are used for objects - not the semi-colon as in CSS
zet(selector).prop(property, value) - gets or sets a property on a set of tags
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- if an object of properties and values is provided as a single parameter, then sets all these on the set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- else if no value is set then returns an array of the set tags values for the property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- else if value is a single value then sets the property of the tags in the set to the value

PROPERTIES  (on the returned Zet object)
tags - an HTML NodeList tag list

RETURNS Zet object with on(), off(), css() methods and tags property (NodeList tag list)

[00477] zob(func, args, sig, scope)     ~ object

zob
global function

DESCRIPTION
A system to build functions or classes that allow traditional parameters
or a configuration object passed in as a single parameter.
The configuration object has property names that match the function arguments.

To use zob on your own functions, pass in a function and the function's arguments
and insert zob into first line of your function as shown below.
Replace yourFunction with a reference to your function but keep arguments as is.

NOTE: in ES6 classes when extending a ZIM class,
do not use ZIM DUO when passing in parameters to super()
or else the methods might be obscured.

EXAMPLE
function test(a,b,c){
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let duo; if (duo = zob(test, arguments)) return duo;
};
test(1,null,3); // traditional parameters in order
test({a:1,c:3}); // configuration object with zob

NOTE: if you are running the function as a constructor with the new keyword
then you need to pass in this (keyword) as the last parameter (sig can be null)
this allows zob() to test to see if we need to rerun the function as a constructor

EXAMPLE
let duo; if (duo = zob(yourFunction, arguments, sig, this)) return duo;

NOTE: if using an ES6 Class or minifying the file then you need to do an extra step
add a string version of the signature of your function above the duo call
then pass the signature in as a parameter to zob()

EXAMPLE
class Test extends Container {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constructor(a=1,b=2,c=3) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;super();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const sig = "a,b,c";
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let duo; if (duo = zob(Test, arguments, sig, this)) return duo;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
}

many of the ZIM functions and classes use this "DUO" technique
the documentation for parameters will tell you if they support DUO
works also with JS6 default parameter values

PARAMETERS
func - reference to the function you want to use params or a config object with
args - reference to the arguments property of the function (literally, use "arguments" with no quotes)
sig - (default null) a string listing of the parameters just how they are in the () not including the ()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;required if you are minifying the file as minifying changes the signature
scope - (default null) reference to this (litterally, use "this" without the quotes)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;required if the function is being run with the new keyword

RETURNS um... a Boolean

[81374] DISTILL

distill
zim constant

DESCRIPTION
Distill allows you to track which functions you are using in your app
and create a custom minified js file with just those functions.
Set DISTILL to true to record which functions your are using in your app -
default is false.  While running your app, call the distill() function
take the results to https://zimjs.com/distill to create a minified distilled file.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// at the start of your code
DISTILL = true;

// at the end of your code (once everything has run)
// this means we may have to wait for events to happen, etc.
distill();

// this will log to the console a series of numbers
// separated by spaces representing the functions used

[81414] distill()

distill
zim function

DESCRIPTION
Call the distill function to display which zim functions you are using in your app.
You must set DISTILL constant to true before using (set at the start of your app).
After running through your app, call distill() and see the console (F12).
Take the results to https://zimjs.com/distill to create a minified distilled js file.
You would then host this js file yourself or include it in your mobile files, etc.
NOTE: distill() only records functions that have been used
so you may have functions still to be used in your app.
You will want to make sure you call distill() after you have used all your functions,
for instance, on a restart event, etc.
NOTE: distill() will not be available from your distilled file.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// at the start of your code
DISTILL = true;

// at the end of your code (once everything has run)
// this means we may have to wait for events to happen, etc.
distill();

// this will log to the console a series of numbers

************************************
[81850] zimify(obj, a, b, c, d, list)

zimify
global function

DESCRIPTION
Function to add display methods like drag, hitTests, move, animate, center, etc. to an object.
Also adds width, height, widthOnly and heightOnly properties.
The term "members" is used because we are adding both methods and properties.
All the ZIM 4TH display objects come with these members
BUT... the native CreateJS display objects do not.
When we import assets from Adobe Animate, these are native CreateJS objects.
So we can use zimify() to add these members to a CreateJS Shape, Container, etc.

NOTE: this was formerly zim.addDisplayMembers (which has been replaced by zimify)

ZIM uses zimify internally to add the members
to the ZIM shapes and components (Rectangle, Circle, Triangle, Label, Button, etc.)
as applied through the ZIM Container inheritance
as well as to the ZIM wrappers for CreateJS Container, Shape, Sprite, MovieClip objects.
The display methods call the original ZIM functions
passing the object parameter as the first parameter
or if DUO is being used then adds the object to the configuration object.

Also adds common ZIM DisplayObject properties such as:
width, height, widthOnly, heightOnly, level, depth, blendMode
draggable, name, hue, saturation, brightness, contrast
hueBatch, saturationBatch, brightnessBatch, contrastBatch
and perhaps more - see zim.displayBase()

EXAMPLE
const cjsShape = new lib.Shape1(); // include the js from Adobe Animate
zimify(cjsShape, 200, 300); // or 0,0,200,300, for x, y, width, height of bounds
cjsShape.center();
cjsShape.drag();

// otherwise would have to use:
zim.center(cjsShape, stage);
zim.drag(cjsShape); // etc.

EXAMPLE
const shape = new createjs.Shape();
shape.graphics.beginFill(red).drawRect(0,0,200,200);
// need to either setBounds() or pass in dimensions
zimify(shape, 200, 200); // add methods like center, drag, etc.
shape.center(); // ZIM 4TH method format
S.update();

// note: even without using zimify()
// we can use the traditional zim.center() function
var shape = new createjs.Shape();
shape.graphics.beginFill(red).drawRect(0,0,200,200);
shape.setBounds(0,0,200,200); // need to set bounds to center
zim.center(shape, stage); // use the zim function rather than the method
S.update();

// of course we can just use a zim.Shape
// then the methods like center, drag, etc. are already added
var shape = new Shape(200, 200).f(red).dr(0,0,200,200).center();
S.update();

// in this case, we may have well used a Rectangle ;-)
var shape = new Rectangle(200, 200, red);
shape.center();
S.update();

PARAMETERS
obj - the object to add the methods and properties to (probably a CreateJS display object)
a,b,c,d - optional bounds - if the bounds are not already set then provide them here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if only a and b are provided then these are width and height with x, y at 0
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a, b, c, d are provided then these are x, y, width, height of the bounds
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note: on Adobe Animate MovieClips, the objects are stored in a container
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and zimify() will automatically zimify the container and set its width and height to stage width and height
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and bring the container to the top()
list - Boolean used internally by zimplify to exclude zim methods (makes zimify return list of methods)

RETURNS - obj for chaining

MORE: http://zimjs.com/code/bits.html?title=zimify


************************************
[82317] zimplify(exclude)

zimplify
global function

DESCRIPTION
By default, ZIM runs zimplify() so that the zim namespace is not needed.
This can be prevented by setting the global variable zns = true before calling ZIM.
Then if desired zimplify() can be run manually after ZIM is called.

Calling zimplify() removes requirement to use the zim namespace in code
Puts the ZIM code, display and controls into the global namespace
Does not put methods in the namespace as using methods as functions is discouraged
With the exception of loop, stopAnimate, pauseAnimate, animate, wiggle

NOTE: JavaScript Window class is stored as document.Window
and JavaScript Blob class is stored as document.Blob to provide access as these are overwritten by zimplify
Alternatively, zns can be set to true then run zimplify(["Window", "Blob"]);
at which point the zim namespace would be needed for a ZIM Window and ZIM Blob but the others would need no namespace
and the JavaScript Window and Blob would be available as Window and Blob.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// before calling the ZIM script we set the zim namespace to true
// note, by default, zns=false and no zim namespace is needed
&lt;script&gt;zns=true;&lt;/script&gt;

// then in the script we would have to use the namespace
const circle = new zim.Circle(50, zim.green);

// calling zimplify() will avoid that:
zimplify();
const circle2 = new zim.Circle(50, green);

// and we can use zim functions directly
const random = rand(500);

// note - do not use:
const rand = rand(500); // as you will overwrite the rand() reference

PARAMETERS
exclude - (default null) a String command or an array of command strings to not remove the zim namespace



************************************
[82382] fastFrame(cjs, stage)

fastFrame
global function

DESCRIPTION
It is recommended to use a ZIM Frame or if using Adobe Animate to use the ZIM Shim
but if you are just wanting to use some ZIM features and are working primarily with CreateJS
or legacy CreateJS code - then just call fastFrame() before using ZIM code.
Pass the createjs namespace and the current stage into fastFrame().
fastFrame() will create and return a very light placeholder frame as a zdf
and will handle various scaling settings due to ZIM Retina.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// fastFrame is not needed with ZIM Frame or with ZIM Shim
// imagine that CreateJS is imported as createjs - or cjs, etc.
const stage = new createjs.Stage("demoCanvas");
fastFrame(createjs, stage);
new Circle().center().drag(); // center will now default to centering on stage

PARAMETERS
createjs - (default null) a reference to the CreateJS namespace
stage - (default null) a reference to the CreateJS stage



************************************
[82425] addWires(obj)

addWires
global function

DESCRIPTION
Add wire(), noWire(), wired(), noWired() methods to any object
See the methods in docs under DiplayObject methods
These can be added to custom objects to wire properties.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const slider = new Slider().center();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const tabs = new Tabs({tabs:["summer", "fall", "winter", "spring"]}).pos(0,0,TOP,RIGHT);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const data = {size:10, season:"summer"};
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// addWires returns the object data - which will now have the wired method
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// now, when the slider or tabs change the data object will be updated
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// note: we want the slider to be set to the object's start value so set the setSource to "target"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// note: we want the text of the tabs not the default selectedIndex so need to provide input property
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;addWires(data).wired(slider, "size", null, "target").wired({source:tabs, prop:"season", input:"text"});

PARAMETERS
obj - the object to receive the wire and wired methods

RETURNS - obj for chainging


************************************
[82480] setBlurDetect()

setBlurDetect
global function

DESCRIPTION
Function to detect browser Window being reduced or set to another tab.
Used by animate, interval and timeout to optionally pause these on blur and activate on focus
animate uses zim.pauseAnimateOnBlur and the interval and ticker use a zim.pauseOnBlur array
As of ZIM Cat 02 (patched) animate uses the target object tweenStates object to determine which animations to start again on focus
Used internally by ZIM - if an object has a pause(type) method then can add it to zim.pauseOnBlur array
to pause the object on window blur and unpause the object on focus

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// will count when window is not seen
const test = interval(1, obj=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(obj.count);
});

EXAMPLE
// will NOT count when window is not seen
const test = interval(1, obj=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zog(obj.count);
}, null, null, null, true);

EVENTS
adds a "tabblur" event to the ZIM Default Frame when blurred
and a "tabfocus" event to the ZIM Default Frame when focused


************************************
[82623] ZIMONON

ZIMONON (note the extra ON at the end of ZIMON - so ZIMONON)
ZIM constant

*** this just turns ZIMON on - see docs for ZIMON next!

DESCRIPTION
Default is false - set to true to record arguments needed for ZIMON.stringify()
If not using ZIMON.stringify() then do not set this to true
See also Docs for Static Class ZIMON

BACKGROUND
Arguments are the values passed in to parameters.
These are stored in a LOCAL variable called arguments that belongs to the object
For ZIMON to stringify an object, it needs to have access to the arguments
So ZIMON requires objects to keep a PUBLIC record in an arguments property
This can add up in memory when the app has hundreds or thousands of objects
For instance, every rectangle, circle and line in a blob control would keep a record of its arguments

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
ZIMONON = true
new Frame({ready});
function ready() {

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const circle = new Circle(100, blue);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const c = ZIMON.stringify(circle);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// store string c in localStorage or send to database
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// ZIMON would only make a default circle if ZIMONON were not true

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// we can parse a ZIMON string without needing ZIMONON set to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// so if the app only read in a ZIMON string
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// then there would be no reason to set ZIMONON to true
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const cc = ZIMON.parse(cc).center(); // centers a blue circle

}

[82672] ZIMON = {}

ZIMON
zim static class

DESCRIPTION
ZIMON stands for ZIM Object Notation
It turns any prepared** object to a string using ZIMON.stringify(object)
It turns a ZIMON string back into and object using ZIMON.parse(string)
The object can be inside an array [] or an object literal {}
These can be nested and filled with any type of object (that is prepared**)
See https://zimjs.com/zimon/ for an example

NOTE: must set ZIMONON=true at START of app to record arguments (note the extra ON)
it is not that much extra data but it is prudent to conserve memory when not using ZIMON
ZIMONON is needed only to stringify(), for parse() it does not matter

KEY
An optional key object can be used to specify the scope of the class
and to specify which properties to store for objects made from a class.
The scope must be a string accessible from where you stringify - it can contain dots (.)
The key can be passed as the second parameter to ZIMON.stringify().
The key is sent in the ZIMON string and nothing extra is needed when parsing.

PURPOSE
The purpose is similar to JSON - to save to localStorage or databases or share between languages.
Indeed, the final ZIMOM format is JSON.
Like JSON, ZIMON can be used outside of ZIM and outside JavaScript if implemented in another language.
See https://github.com/danzen/zimon/ for generic JS code to port to other languages.

** PREPARED OBJECTS
Any objects NOT supported by JSON must be prepared
so objects other than string, number, array, object literal, boolean or null
need to have the following:
1. A type property that matches the class name as a string
2. An arguments property that holds an array of the arguments passed to make the object
The ZIM Objects are already prepared - so no extra work is required

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
const objects = [new Rectangle(100,100,red), new Circle(50, blue)];
const zimon = ZIMON.stringify(objects); // could save in localStorage or send to database

const newObjects = ZIMON.parse(zimon); // makes a Rectangle and Circle in a []
newObjects[0].center();
newObjects[1].center().animate({scale:.5}, 1);
zog(newObjects[0].color); // #fb4758 zim red

EXAMPLE
// pass a key for any properties to remember
const objects = [new Rectangle(100,100,red).alp(.5), new Circle(50, blue).sca(2).loc({x:200,y:200,add:false})];
const key = {Rectangle:{props:["alpha"]}, Circle:{props:["scale", "x", "y"]}};
const zimon = ZIMON.stringify(objects, key); // could save in localStorage or send to database

const newObjects = ZIMON.parse(zimon); // makes a Rectangle and Circle in a []
newObjects[0].center(); // would have alpha .5
newObjects[1].addTo().animate({scale:.5, x:W/2, y:H/2}, 1); // would start at scale 2 and x,y of 100,100

EXAMPLE
// To prepare custom objects:
Custom = function(a, b, c) { // ** global scope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.type = "Custom"; // ZIMON uses a type property that matches the class name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// best to take copy of arguments and turn them into array
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// otherwise any changes to argument values (setting defaults, etc) will be needlessly recorded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// when ZIMON.stringify() is eventually called
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.arguments = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.write = function() {console.log(a, b, c);}
}
const c = new Custom("one", "two", "three");
const c2 = ZIMON.stringify(c);
const c3 = ZIMON.parse(c2);
c3.write(); // logs one two three

// ** or save in some namespace or on an object
F.Custom = function(a, b, c) {// same as above}
const c = new F.Custom("one", "two", "three");
// then use key as second parameter to specify scope
const c2 = ZIMON.stringify(c, {Custom:{scope:"frame"}}); // key
const c3 = ZIMON.parse(c2);
c3.write(); // logs one two three

EXAMPLE
// a built-in JavaScript Object:
const date = new Date(1982, 0, 10);
date.type = "Date"; // add date
date.arguments = [1982, 0, 10]; // and manual arguments
const d = ZIMON.stringify(date);
const d2 = ZIMON.parse(d);
zog(d2.getYear()); // 82


STATIC METHODS
stringify(obj, key) - supply an object to convert to a ZIMON string
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the object can be any JSON ready object - string, number, array, object literal, boolean or null
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the object can be any ZIM DisplayObject - Circle, Blob, Button, Tile, Emitter, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the object can be a prepared custom or built in object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a type property of the class name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with an arguments property of the arguments - see ** PREPARED OBJECTS above
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or any combination of these - ZIMON is recursive so checks parameters, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the optional key can be used to specify scope for the class if not in global scope
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and used to specify which properties should be recorded
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the key has the following format:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ClassName:{scope:"inScope.nested.etc", props:["prop1", "prop2", "etc"]}, ClassName2:{}, etc.}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stringify returns a ZIMON string in JSON format
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eg.'{"obj":{"zimon":"Rectangle","args":[30,30,"#e472c4"]},"props":[0.3,212,184]},"key":{"Tile":{"props":["alpha","x","y"]}},"zimon":1,"info":"https://zimjs.com/zimon/"}';
parse(string) - pass in the ZIMON string to turn back into an object (or objects within objects)

[82920] Wonder(wid, client, app, notes, server)

Wonder
zim class

DESCRIPTION
Wonder sends counts, times, and orders to a server for user testing or statistical purposes.
Go to http://zimjs.com/wonder/ to get a Wonder ID (wid) and set up Wonder stats with ZIM
or make up your own wid and use your own server script to collect data.
See the zim Wonder site for the data fields that are sent.
NOTE: all records at ZIM are archived NEW YEARS DAY and kept for a year after that.
Service is provided as is and ZIM and Dan Zen are not responsible for lost data.

USAGE
count will count things like app loads, button clicks within an app, how many monsters they killed
time will tell you the time the user took to do something - like solve a puzzle, or locate the witch
order will record the order items were done - which section did they go to first, second, third, etc.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// make a Wonder object
// wonderID is e-mailed to you when you sign up
// client is your client's name that you provide
// app is the app for which you are recording data
// you can also pass an optional note
var wonder = new Wonder("wonderID", "client", "app");

// COUNT EXAMPLE
// for this example we count times a button is pressed
const button = new Button("CLICK").center();
button.on("click", ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// records an entry for this keyword in your stats
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// along with date, time, session, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wonder.count("wow");
});

// TIME EXAMPLE
// assuming we have our Wonder object from above
// (you only need one Wonder object)
// start the timer counting for a keyword called "test"
// this will record nothing until you timeEnd()
// or you timeStart() again
// you can also timePause() and timeUnpause()
// see DOCS for more functionality and information
wonder.timeStart("test");

// add the circle
const circle = new Circle(100, red).center().drag();
circle.on("pressup", function(){
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (circle.hitTestRect(square)) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// if the shapes are hitting then end the timer
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// this will send data to your Wonder report
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wonder.timeEnd("test");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
});

// add the square to a random location on stage
const square = new Rectangle(100, "yellow").loc(rand(W-square.width), rand(H-square.height));

// ORDER EXAMPLE
// assuming we have our Wonder object from above
// (you only need one Wonder object)

// make tabs
const tabs = new Tabs(400, 40, ["MOUSE", "CAT", "MONKEY"]);
tabs.selectedIndex = -1; // start with no selection
let count = 0; // perhaps get the first four presses
tabs.center().change(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// record which tab was pressed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// this gets stored under keyword animal
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wonder.order("animal", tabs.text);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;count++;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// turn the order recording off for "animal"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (count == 4) wonder.orderOff("animal");
});

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
wid - string with your company wonder ID for example z14i46m3z29
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  this is the ID you are e-mailed when you sign up or sign in with your company name
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  this is NOT your company name that you log into Wonder with
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  NOTE: recording to a non-registered wid on the ZIM server will not work and there is no error message
client - the client the app is for - if it is for your company, just put your company
app - the app or site the Wonder stats are for
notes - (default null) any extra notes like any user data (limit 256 characters as it is stored each record)
server - a server with zim Wonder running
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: the default value for the server parameter has been removed as it risks being out-of-date
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have signed up for ZIM Wonder at https://zimjs.com/wonder/ then
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;import https://zimjs.org/cdn/zimserver_urls.js in your code (script tag up top)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this gives a global zimWonderURL variable for you to pass into the server parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the zimserver_url.js script will always hold the latest domain:port for the zim server

METHODS
count(keyword) - sends a line to the server script with the given keyword as well as date and time
timeStart(keyword) - starts timing for the specified keyword (nothing sent to server yet)
timePause(keyword) - pauses the timing for this keyword
timeUnpause(keyword) - unpauses the timing for this keyword
timeEnd(keyword) - ends timing for the specific keyword and sends the time to the server
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE: if the user exits the app (or leaves page) nothing gets sent to the server
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  due to unreliable beforeUnload events in the HTML world (otherwise all this would be batched)
order(keyword, item) - sends a line to the server for this item along with a unique order id for the keyword for the user

countOff(keyword) - prevents counts from being sent for this keyword
countOn(keyword) - allows counts from being sent for this keyword (default)
timeOff(keyword) - prevents sending time to the server for this keyword
timeOn(keyword) - allows sending time to the server for this keyword (default)
orderOff(keyword) - prevents sending orders to the server for this keyword
orderOn(keyword) - allows sending orders for this keyword (default)

dispose() - clear any event listeners, etc.

[83127] VERSION

VERSION
zim constant

DESCRIPTION
The version of the ZIM code that is running.
The version is considered the file name after the CDN and before the .js or _doc.js.
For example, the first version of ZIM Cat is cat/00/zim for both the docs version and the minified version
See also the ZIM getLatestVersions() function for the latest versions of ZIM and other ZIM related files.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// the latest versions are on the CDN
// getLastestVersions will access them with ZIM async()
// and provide an versions object in the parameter of the callback function
getLatestVersions(function(versions) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (VERSION == versions.zim) zogg(VERSION + " is the latest version");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else zogy(VERSION + " is not the latest version");
});


************************************
[83154] getLatestVersions(call)

getLatestVersions
zim function

DESCRIPTION
Gets the latest versions of ZIM and other ZIM related files.
A version is considered the file name after the CDN and before the .js or _doc.js.
For example, the first version of ZIM Cat is cat/00/zim for both the docs version and the minified version.
The versions for CreateJS on ZIM CDN might be 1.3.0/createjs and for Pizzazz 3 is pizzazz_03
Also see the ZIM VERSION constant for the current version

NOTE: also see the top of the Docs for all the latest files

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// the latest versions are on the CDN
// getLastestVersions will access them with ZIM async()
// and provide an versions object in the parameter of the callback function
getLatestVersions(function(versions) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (VERSION == versions.zim) zogg(VERSION + " is the latest version");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else zogy(VERSION + " is not the latest version");
});

PARAMETERS
call - a callback function with a versions object is provided to the parameter
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the version object has version properties for the following:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zim, createjs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pizzazz01, pizzazz02, pizzazz03,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;physics, three, game, socket,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;threejs, orbitcontrols, box2d, socketio, easystar


************************************
[83198] PWA(call, label, backgroundColor, color, backdropColor, pane, noScale)

PWA
zim class extends a CreateJS EventDispatcher

DESCRIPTION
Class to insert a message for the user to add the app
to their mobile device home screen.

PWA
Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are a way to run Web apps similar to native apps.
These are used primarily for mobile so the app runs without the Browser interface
and also can run without the Internet, if a proper service worker is set up.
See https://zimjs.com/mobile

ZIM ZAPPS
There are a few requirements and files that need to be set up for PWA.
See the ZIM Zapps PWA page at https://zimjs.com/zapps.html
The extra PWA files can be made with a tool at https://zimjs.com/zapps

The PWA class inserts a message into a ZIM app if both the following are true:

1. the app is on mobile
2. the app is not being launched already from the device home screen

The message encourages the user to add the file to the home screen (A2HS).
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Add_to_home_screen

HOW IT WORKS
Make a new PWA() object and pass it an optional function that runs your app.
In either case, an invite the user to add to the home screen message will pop up
if the app is on mobile running from a browser - otherwise there will be no message.

A. If there is no function then the pane can be closed and that is it.
If you want the pane to show up on top then add new PWA() at the end.

B. If a function is provided - eg. new PWA(init); then
when the pane is closed it will call the init function.
If there is no need for a message then PWA() calls the init function right away.

NOTE: the ZIM Zapps tool will insert a PWA call - which can be adjusted if necessary.

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
function ready() { // Frame ready callback
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// PWA will show a message if user is on mobile and launching from a browser
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// The app will wait until the message is closed then start
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// or will run right away if there is no message needed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// such as when not on mobile or already launching from home screen on mobile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// to test the app on desktop, use new PWA(init).show();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new PWA(init);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function init() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// your app code
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// init is a common function name to start an app
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// but the function can be called whatever you want
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// such as startApp, playGame, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
} // end ready

EXAMPLE
function ready() { // Frame ready callback
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Here we run the app and just add a PWA message on top
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// only if user is on mobile and launching from a browser
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// no message would appear if not on mobile or already running from home screen on mobile
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// add app code here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new PWA(); // add at end to pop on top of app
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
} // end ready

EXAMPLE
function ready() { // Frame ready callback
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// like the last example but may want to start the app
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// when the user closes the message or if there is no message
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// add app code here
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// function to start animation, for example
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function startAnimation() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const pwa = new PWA(); // add at end to pop on top of app
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// this event will fire if there is no message or when message is closed
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pwa.on("ready", startAnimation);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
} // end ready

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
call - (default null) the function to call to start the app
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if left out then nothing will happen when the PWA closes (also see ready event)
label - (default "Please add to home screen as an app") along with an icon at left
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can add different words here or add a custom ZIM Label
backgroundColor - (default yellow) background color of pane (any CSS color)
color - (default black) font color of label on pane (any CSS color)
backdropColor - (default "rgba(0,0,0,.2)") the color of the background that fills the stage
pane - (default null) can specify a custom Pane instead of the last four parameters
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this will be scaled to the 105% the stage width unless noScale is set to true (see below)
noScale - (default false) set to true to not scale the Pane (see pane parameter for custom pane)

METHODS
show() - test the PWA message on desktop for instance - remember to remove the show!


EVENTS
dispatches a ready event if the pane is closed or if there was no pane
but usually, just pass the callback as the first parameter

[83391] QR(url, color, backgroundColor, size, clickable, correctLevel)

QR
zim class extends a ZIM Bitmap which extends a CreateJS Bitmap

DESCRIPTION
Class to make a QR Code Bitmap from a QRCode library by David Shim

NOTE: must import https://zimjs.org/cdn/qrcode.js in a script tag

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
new QR("http://danzen.com").sca(.5).pos(40,40,RIGHT,BOTTOM);

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
url - (default "https://zimjs.com") url string the QR code will open
color - (default black) the darker color
backgroundColor - (default white) the lighter color
size - (default 256) the width and height of the QR code
clickable - (default true) set to false to not click the QR code to go to the URL
correctLevel - (default 2) numbers from 0(M), 1(L), 2(H), 3(Q) corresponding to density
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Info from: https://blog.qrstuff.com/2011/12/14/qr-code-error-correction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lower the error correction level, the less dense the QR code image is, which improves minimum printing size.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher the error correction level, the more damage it can sustain before it becomes unreadabale.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level L or Level M represent the best compromise between density and ruggedness for general marketing use.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level Q and Level H are generally recommended for industrial environments where keeping the QR code clean or un-damaged will be a challenge.

[83457] GIF(file, width, height, startPaused)

GIF
zim class extends a ZIM Bitmap which extends a CreateJS Bitmap

DESCRIPTION
Class to make an animated gif from the gifler library by madCreator
https://themadcreator.github.io/gifler/

See: https://zimjs.com/nft/bubbling/gif.html

NOTE: must import https://zimjs.org/cdn/gifler.js in a script tag

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
// dimensions must be provided otherwise will be 100x100
new GIF("path/file.gif", 200, 100).pos(40,40,RIGHT,BOTTOM);

EXAMPLE
const gif = new GIF("path/file.gif", 200, 100)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.center()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.tap(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gif.pause(!gif.paused);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});

EXAMPLE
const gif = new GIF("path/file.gif", 200, 100).center();
timeout(1, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gif.reset(); // goes back to start and would play from start
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// to pause on reset seems to need a little time...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timeout(.05, ()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gif.pause();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timeout(1, ()=&gt;{

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gif.pause(false);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});
});

PARAMETERS supports DUO - parameters or single object with properties below
file - url string to the animated gif
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see ZIM PATH global variable as will get added to the start of the file
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and is also automatically set if a path is added to Frame() or loadAssets() parameters
width - (default 100) the width to show the gif
height - (default 100) the height to show the gif
startPaused - (default false) set to true to startPaused
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also see the pause() method - but do not use the method to start paused

METHODS
pause(state) - pause or unpause the gif

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see also the startPaused parameter
stop() - stop the gif (same as dispose())
keyout(color, tolerance, replacement) - remove color from Bitmap and a tolerance between 0-1
the default color is "#389b26" which is a medium dark green
the default tolerance is .1 - the higher the tolerance the less sensitive the keying process - so more colors will be removed similar to the provided color
color and tolerance can be an array of colors and tolerances (or just one tolerance if all are the same)
replacement (default clear) a color to replace the keyed out color with or an optional array to match the colors array if an array is used
reset() - restarts the GIF
dispose() - delete the GIF and remove Ticker

PROPERTIES
type - holds the class name as a String
paused - get whether the animated gif is paused - see pause() to change
ticker - the ZIM Ticker function that is updating the stage
gifler - the Gifler object - see https://themadcreator.github.io/gifler/
animator - the Gifler animator


************************************
[83648] THEME()

THEME
zim static class

DESCRIPTION
ZIM Theme changes the ZIM colors to themed sets of colors
and it can set darkness (and lightness with negative) and tint as well.

Use the class directly like: Theme.set("themeName");
This affects everywhere a ZIM color is used AFTER the theme is set.
This includes default colors for components like Button colors, etc.
but not some interface colors like Squiggle and Blob control colors.
Use Theme.set("zim") to go back to traditional ZIM colors.
This will go back to ZIM colors for anything made afterwards
but will not change objects that are already made.

To change colors of objects already made, use Theme.apply("themeName");
Warning: using Theme.apply() will reload the page.
To apply new theme colors to objects already made without reloading the page
use Theme.set() and then adjust button.backgroundColor = red; etc.
A read-only THEME global object is set when a theme is set or applied.
An applied theme will be re-applied when the page is reloaded.
Use Theme.clear() to reload the page with no theme set.

COLORS AND SHADES
Themes will work on the following built in ZIM colors and shades (no quotes):
red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, brown, interstellar
black, licorice, darker, dark, charcoal, grey, granite, tin, pewter, silver, fog, mist, light, moon, lighter, white
Note: the shades are #000, #111, etc. to #eee, #fff

THEMES
There are colors and greys (including white and black).
"zim" - the original ZIM colors and greys
"html" - the colors are replaced with HTML version so blue is "blue".  Greys left the same.
"future" - the colors and greys are taken from AI visions of the future.
"invert" - the colors and the greys are inverted - as in a difference against white.
"greyscale" - the colors are set to greys.
"neon" - even more vibrant than ZIM colors! Greys are set towards white and black.
"seventies" - check out the shag on my app - greys are adjusted too.
"warm" - lovely mediterranean colors... mmm - greys are adjusted too.

CUSTOMIZE
An object literal with colors and values can be passed to set() or apply() as the first parameter
And a lightness ratio from -1 to 1 can be applied with negative making the colors darker
So Theme.set("zim", .3); would lighten all the regular ZIM colors and greys by 30% for objects made after setting.
Theme.apply("future", -.2); would reload the page and apply a future colors and greys 20% darker.
The 3rd and 4th parameters are for tint and tintRatio - just like ZIM toColor().
So Theme.set("zim", 0, red, .5) would make all ZIM colors and greys be half way to red.
The last parameter is exceptions which can be one color or an array of colors to not apply the theme to.
Special "colors" and "greys" strings can be used to not include all colors or all greys.
So Theme.set("zim", 0, red, .5, "greys"); would redden only the colors.
Theme.set("future", .2, null, null, ["yellow", "white"]); would except yellow and white.

See: https://zimjs.com/zim/theme.html

NOTE: as of ZIM 5.5.0 the zim namespace is no longer required (unless zns is set to true before running zim)

EXAMPLE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// This will make three buttons, two with zim theme and one with greyscale theme
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Button().loc(100,100); // will be ZIM colors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theme.set("greyscale");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Button().center(); // will be in greyscale
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theme.set("zim");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Button().pos(100,100,RIGHT,BOTTOM); // will be ZIM colors

EXAMPLE
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;F.color = darker;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new Tile(new Circle(30, [blue, green, red, orange, yellow]), 12, 5, 20, 20).center();
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const button = new Button({label:THEME.name=="neon"?"ZIM":"NEON"}).pos(0,30,CENTER,BOTTOM).tap(()=&gt;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (button.text=="NEON") Theme.apply("neon"); // will reload page as neon
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else Theme.apply("zim"); // will reload page as zim
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});

EXAMPLE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theme.set("zim", .1, red, .2, "greys");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// anything that gets made from now on will have slightly lighter zim colors tinted a little red
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// but the greys will remain default

EXAMPLE &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theme.set("zim", -.5, null, null, "colors");
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// anything that gets made from now on will have darker greys

METHODS
set(name, lightenRatio, tint, tintRatio, exclude) |ZIM DUO| - set a theme to be used after setting
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name (default "zim") one of "zim", "html", "future", "invert", "neon", "seventies", "warm"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lightenRatio (default null) set between -1 and 1 to darken (to black) if negative or lighten (to white) if positive
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this works like ZIM lighten()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tint (default null) a color to tint to
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this works like ZIM toColor(tint, ratio)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tintRatio (default 0) set between 0-1 to apply a ratio of tint
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exclude (default none) a color or array of colors to exclude - these will stay ZIM default colors
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;convenience colors: "colors" and "greys" can also be used to exclude all colors or all greys
apply(name, lightenRatio, tint, tintRatio, exclude) |ZIM DUO| - relaod the app with the applied theme
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see the parameters for set() above
clear() - reloads the page with no theme set
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to stop applying a theme going forward, use set("zim") for the default ZIM colors

CONSTANTS
THEME - a Theme object literal with name, lightnessRatio, tint, tintRatio and exclude properties - see set() method parameters
