JavaScript Canvas Framework - Code Creativity!<br>
https://zimjs.com

A consistent, complete, simple and colorful Canvas Framework that provides quick visual results.  ZIM is great for learning to code but also powerful for professionals to make games, apps, art and more for desktop and mobile!

Please see the About section for why we use ZIM to make Interactive Media.<br>

## Examples
There are many examples of things to be made with ZIM in the banner sections on the ZIM site<br>
Here is the main example section including CodePen examples - we hope you like them!<br>
https://zimjs.com/examples.html 

Coding in ZIM looks like this:

```
new Rectangle(50, 50, green).center().drag(); // for a centered draggable rectangle!

new MotionController(new Emitter(), "mousemove"); // for a particle emitter following the mouse

const squiggle = new Squiggle().loc(100, 100); // wavy line with Bezier handles
new Circle(20, pink).addTo().animate({path:squiggle}, 1000); // animate along a squiggle

new Button(200, 70, "TRY ME")
  .pos(30,30,RIGHT,BOTTOM) 
  .tap(()=>{zgo("https://zimjs.com");}); // go to URL
  
```
